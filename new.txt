The system utilizes vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) toshare safety critical state information, allowing fordistributed implementation of our provably safe algo-rithms. Safety is achieved in potential collision scenar-ios by controlling the velocities of both vehicles withautomatic brake and throttle commands. Automaticcommands can never cause the violation of predefinedupper and lower speed limits.I. IntroductionIn this paper, we present experimental re-sults from an Intelligent Transportation System(ITS), which we call the Intersection CollisionAvoidance (ICA) application, designed to pre-vent collisions between two vehicles passingthrough an intersection. According to data takenin 2009 by the Fatality Analysis Reporting Sys-tem (FARS) and the General Estimates System(GES), about 40.1 percent of all crashes in theThe authors would like to thank Je¡þLovell, Je¡þRogers, ChrisPeplin and Chris Hammond for their contribution to hardwareand software development, and Keiji Shibata for help withexperimentation. This work has been in part funded by NSF-GOALI Award CMMI-0854907.United States were intersection-related crashes[18]. A study conducted by the National High-way Tra¡þc Safety Administration (NHTSA) onintersection-related crashes in 2010 [19] con-cluded that 44.1 percent of intersection-relatedcrashes were most directly attributed to inade-quate driver surveillance, compared to only 7.3percent in non-intersection-related crashes.Previous work concerning formal approachesto ITS involved the automated highway systems(AHS) by the California PATH project in the90s. The objective of the AHS project was to de-velop fully autonomous highway systems, withthe goal of decreasing congestion, increasingsafety, and improving fuel e¡þciency [12,13,20,23]. Most of this work pertaining to safetyinvolved the development of vehicle platooning,where formal modeling and control solutionswere employed based on the computation thelargest unsafe set, drawing from techniques inoptimal control and game theory [1-3,10,14,16,17,22]. Recent work concerning the design ofintelligentintersections revolvesaround provablysafe scheduling algorithms for large numbers ofvehicles [15].The aim of ICA is to prevent collisions atintersections after normal tra¡þc control mech-anisms have failed. The ICA application couldbe employed in a real-world scenario where adriver turns right at a red light without properly(or incorrectly) surveying oncoming tra¡þc. Ifthe right turning vehicle enters the intersectionbefore the oncoming vehicle, ICA will issue athrottle command to the vehicle turning right,while simultaneously issuing a brake commandto the oncoming vehicle. These commands areissued in a manner that does not cause theviolation of predefined speed limits (either traf-fic laws or comfort levels), more precisely, thebraking command will not cause the vehiclevelocity to become less than a minimum speed,while the accelerating command will not causethe vehicle velocity to become greater than amaximum speed. This implies that automaticcontrol commands applied to prevent collisionsat the intersection do not create hazardous driv-ing conditions for other vehicles not directlyinvolved.Central to our approach is the assumption that,after making high level route decisions, driversfollow predefined paths when driving throughintersections. These paths are defined by drivinglanes, and drivers do not change lanes once theyenter the intersection. This assumption allowsus to model collisions between two vehicles asa set of vehicle configurations on these paths,as seen in Figure 1. Collisions between twovehicles are prevented by only controlling thelongitudinal velocity and displacement of eachvehicle along its path, never controlling vehiclesteering. We assume each vehicle is equippedwith sensors for state measurement (absoluteposition, heading, velocity, acceleration, braketorque, and pedal position), non-interrupted V2Vcommunication, and the ability to automaticallyactuate the throttle and brake. Under the aboveassumptions, the safety algorithms implementedhave been mathematically shown to guaranteethe two vehicles passing through the intersectionnever collide [6-8,11].This paper is organized as follows. We de-scribe the test vehicles including sensors, ac-tuators and computational resources in SectionII. In Section III, we provide the modelingFig. 1. Example of two adjacent vehicles approaching a fourway intersection along predefined paths, the location of potentialcollisions is indicated around the intersection of the paths.approach taken on the two vehicles approachingthe intersection. In Section IV, we introduce theformal collision avoidance problem, and providethe formal solution. In Section V, we describethe software implementation of our formal so-lution. In Section VI, the experimental setup isprovided including the intersection configurationconsidered. Lastly, in Section VII we present ourexperimental results.II. Test VehicleThe test vehicles used in these experimentsare modified Lexus IS250 (2007) test vehicles.The modifications include: (a) computer run-ning a Linux operating system; (b) Di¡þerentialGlobal Positioning System (DGPS) for position,absolute time and heading; (c) DENSO Wire-less Safety Unit (WSU) capable of V2V andVehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC); (d) connectionto the Controller-Area Network (CAN) bus toread information from vehicle sensors (velocity,acceleration, brake pedal position, transmissionstate, etc.); (e) CAN bus interface with brakeand throttle actuators. We provide illustrationsof some of these systems in Figure 2.(a) (b)(c)Fig. 2. Modified Lexus IS250 vehicles used in the experiments.In (a), a front profile of one test vehicle is provided. In (b), thetop mounted WSU antenna is shown. In (c), system componentsare highlighted: main computer running the application, DGPSreceiver, computer interface with the CAN bus, and Denso WSU.A. Positioning and Inertial MeasurementsThe on-board DGPS unit is capable of .45 maccuracy for absolute position, 1.5¡þaccuracy forabsolute heading, and .1 s accuracy for absolutetime. The measurement update rate is 10 Hz.Other sensors include: (i) accelerometer, basedon MEMS technology, capable of .5 m/s2 accu-racy; (ii) speedometer, measuring average speedat the wheel, capable .5 m/s accuracy; (iii) throt-tle pedal measurement, capable of .5 % accuracy;(iv) brake torque applied at wheel, capable of .5Nm accuracy.B. Communication SystemA Denso WSU is used for V2V commu-nication, which utilizes the industry standardDSRC message standard. The WSU has a CPUfor eventual implementation of our algorithms,however at the moment is only used for sendingand receiving messages.Due to the requirement of uninterrupted V2Vcommunication, we mount the WSU antennaon the vehicle roof, thus preventing packet lossoften attributed to non-line-of-sight (NLOS). SeeSection 4.3.1 of [4] for an investigation of DSRC5.9 GHz performance under varying line-of-sight(LOS) conditions.C. ComputationThe on-board computer mounted in the wheelwell runs the Ubuntu open-source Linux dis-tribution, which allows for rapid developmentand testing of Driver Safety Systems (DSS). Theconsole display is connected to the computer vias-video, and a remote keyboard allows operationof the computer. The CPU is an Intel Core-Duo2.0 GHz processor, with 1 GB of memory anda 150 GB hard drive. All software is compiledand run on this computer.III. Modeling FormalismWe introduce the mathematical formalismused to describe the two-vehicle system. Werely on the fundamental assumption: as vehiclesapproach an intersection with high level routedecided, tra¡þc control mechanisms cause vehi-cles to take predefined trajectories through theintersection. In Figure 3, example trajectories aregiven for two adjacent vehicles coming togetherat a four way intersection. In the sequel, we willassume the collision scenario under study is theone presented in Figure 1, however ICA can beemployed for any fixed choice of path.To develop this formalism, we first presentsome basic mathematical notation. We then de-velop a single vehicle model, and extend it to thetwo-vehicle model. The utility of this modelingformalism lies in the ability of representing allcollisions as a set of two-vehicle configurations,which will be developed in Section IV.A. Mathematical NotationWe denote the real numbers R and the non-negative real numbers R+. For the set U ¡þR,Fig. 3. Set of possible trajectories that could generate collisionsbetween two adjacent vehicles passing through a four way inter-section. The location of possible collisions is indicated aroundthe intersections of paths.we denote the set of causal signals as S(U), thatis, the set of all functions f : R ¡ú U ¡È{ 0}such that f(t) = 0 for all t < 0. For the functionf : X ¡úY, and set A ¡þ X, we will use thenotation f(A): =?x¡ÊA f(x). We use the intervalnotation ]a,b[ to represent an open interval, thatis, we have x ¡Ê]a,b[ if and only if a < x < b.B. Single Vehicle ModelWe use the state space X ¡Á V to model thedynamic state of the vehicle, where X representsthe set of all possible longitudinal displacementsand V represents the set of all possible lon-gitudinal velocities. The corresponding vector(x,v) ¡ÊX ¡Á V denotes the state of the vehicle,where the x is the longitudinal displacement ofthe vehicle center of mass and v is the tangentialvelocity of the vehicle center of mass. We usethe control space U := [uL,uH] ¡þR to representthe scalar combination of all possible pedal andbrake torque inputs, where uL represents themaximum brake torque command, and uH rep-resents the maximum throttle torque command.We will denote the set of control signals S(U)where u ¡ÊS(U) is called the control signal.We introduce the flow of the system, given bythe function ¦Õ: R+¡ÁX¡ÁV¡ÁS(U) ¡úX¡ÁV, whichdefines the evolution of the vehicle state as timegoes forward [9], assumed to be generated by acontrolled dynamical system f : X ¡Á V ¡Á U ¡úX ¡ÁV. That is, for an initial state (x,v) ¡ÊX ¡ÁV,control signal u ¡ÊS(U), and time t ¡Ý0, the stateof the vehicle at time t is given as ¦Õ(t,(x,v),u) ¡ÊX ¡Á V, where ¦Õ1(t,(x,v),u) ¡Ê X is the lon-gitudinal displacement, and ¦Õ2(t,(x,v),u) ¡Ê Vis the longitudinal velocity. The flow historyover an interval of time, mathematically givenas ¦Õ([0,t],(x,v),u), will be called a trajectoryof the system. We provide an example in Figure4, where the control signal u ¡ÊS(U) is provided,along with the trajectory both in the state spaceX ¡Á V and from a top-down view.C. Two-Vehicle ModelWe next develop a two-vehicle modeling for-malism, which will be used extensivelyto formu-late the collisionavoidance problem, describe thealgorithm implementation, and interpret experi-mental data. We adopt the formalism of parallelcomposition to construct the two-vehicle model,where we can define a state vector for the entiresystem as (x,v): = (x1, x2,v1,v2) ¡Ê X ¡Á V :=X1 ¡Á X2 ¡Á V1 ¡Á V2, where (x1,v1) ¡ÊX1 ¡Á V1 isthe state of vehicle 1, and (x2,v2) ¡ÊX2 ¡Á V2 isthe state of vehicle 2 (see [5] for more details).The control signal for the entire system is nowgiven as u := (u1,u2) ¡ÊS(U): = S(U1) ¡Á S(U2),where u1 ¡ÊS(U1) is the control signal to vehicle1, and u2 ¡ÊS(U2) is the control signal to vehicle2. The flow of the entire system is given by¦Õ(t,(x,v),u) ¡Ê X ¡Á V, where ¦Õ1(t,(x,v),u) ¡ÊX represents a vector of displacements, and¦Õ2(t,(x,v),u) ¡Ê V represents a vector of ve-locities. We denote the flow of vehicle 1 as¦Õ1(t,(x,v),u) ¡ÊX1¡ÁV1 and the flow of vehicle 2as ¦Õ2(t,(x,v),u) ¡ÊX2¡ÁV2. To help illustrate thisformalism, Figure 5 depicts an example of twovehicles approaching the intersection, both in thephysical environment, and within the abstractstate space X ¡Á V.IV. Problem Statement and SolutionIn this section, we present both the formalcollision avoidance problem, and the solution we(a)(b)(c)Fig. 4.

In (c), a top down snapshot of the systemis shown at time 0 and time t > 0.implement. We start by formulating the problemin a mathematical manner consistent with thetwo-vehicle modeling approach introduced inSection III-C. We then present a solution to thisproblem with many technical details omitted, for(a)(b)(c)Fig. 5. Example trajectory of the two-vehicle system with initialcondition (x1,v1) = (2,5) and (x2,v2) = (5,10), accelerating inputu1 to vehicle 1 and braking input u2 to vehicle 2 as shown. In(a), the input signals u1 and u2 are shown up to time t. In (b),the initial condition (x,v), trajectory ¦Õ([0,t],(x,v),u), and finalstate ¦Õ(t,(x,v),u) are shown within the state space X¡ÁV (whichis in 4-dimensional space). In (c), a top down snapshot of thesystem is shown at time 0 and time t.which the interested reader is referred to [6].A. ProblemWe formalize collision avoidance as the prob-lem of avoiding a bad set of two-vehicle statesB¡þ X, which represents the set of all displace-ments along the path corresponding to a colli-sion. With the modeling formalism introduced inSection III-C, we can define the bad set directly(a)(b)Fig. 6. Construction of the bad set B from the path geometry.In (a), the red circle denotes the location of potential intersectioncollisions, where the upper and lower bounds, H1,H2 and L1,L2respectively, are shown along the paths. The paths are whitedotted lines, with the sections inside the bad set highlightedbright red. In (b), the bad set B is shown within the space of two-vehicle displacements X. If the displacement of the two-vehiclesystem is inside the bad set, mathematically given by x ¡ÊB , thena collision has occurred.from the path geometry. In particular, for eachpath we can find a lower and upper displace-ment, such that if both vehicles are within theirrespective bounds, then we have a collision. Thebad set can thus be defined asB :=?x ¡ÊX | x1 ¡Ê]L1,H1[ and x2 ¡Ê]L2,H2[?,where L1 < H1 and L2 < H2 are displacementsalong the respective paths, as seen in Figure 6.Therefore, the formal collision avoidance prob-lem involves designing a controller that preventsthe flow of the system from entering the bad setB.B. SolutionTo prevent a collision between the two vehi-cles, we apply control based on the constructionof a set C(v) ¡þX called the capture set, whichis parametrized by the current velocity of thetwo-vehicle system. As the name indicates, thecapture set corresponds to the set of vehicledisplacements x ¡ÊX, such that given the currentvehicle velocities v ¡Ê V, no control signalu ¡ÊS(U) can prevent an eventual collision. Thisis mathematically expressed asC(v): =?x ¡ÊX?????¡þu ¡ÊS(U), ¡þt ¡Ý0s.t. ¦Õ1(t,(x,v),u) ¡ÊB?.An example is given in Figure 7, where a two-vehicle configuration is outside of the bad set,but within the capture set.(a)(b)Fig. 7. Example of a two-vehicle system state outside ofthe bad set, but inside of the capture set. In (a), vehicle 1is in the intersection with low velocity, while vehicle 2 isapproaching the intersection with high velocity. In (b), thecorresponding state x is shown in the space of displacements X.All possible future trajectories within X, mathematically given as¦Õ1([0,t],(x,v),S(U)) ¡þX, are depicted as the blue cone. Fromthis depiction, we observe that every trajectory enters the bad setB, implying a collision is immanent. By definition, this impliesthe current state is inside the capture set, mathematically givenby x ¡ÊC (v).Our control approach is entirely based uponthe capture set. We compute the capture set on-line and apply control if the flow enters thecapture set boundary. If the flow enters the lowerboundary of the capture set, which correspondsto a configuration where vehicle 1 will enter theintersection before vehicle 2, the control signalu¡þ = (u1H,u2L) must be applied to avoid thecollision, where vehicle 1 accelerates and vehicle2 brakes. If the flow enters the upper boundary ofthe capture set, which corresponds to a configu-ration where vehicle 2 will enter the intersectionbefore vehicle 1, the control signal u¡þ= (u1L,u2H)must be applied to avoid the collision, wherevehicle 1 brakes and vehicle 2 accelerates. Byconstruction, the resulting control prevents theflow from entering the capture set C(v) and thusthe bad set B, which is formally shown in [6].An example is provided in Figure 8, where thecapture set is shown along with the evaluatedcontrol signal applied to prevent a collision.V. ICA ApplicationThis section contains an overview of the soft-ware components making up ICA. We separatethe major software components into estimation,communication, and control. We first providesome notes regarding the general operation ofall algorithms.A. General OverviewDue to the short-time scales encountered inhigh-velocity collision scenarios, all algorithmsupdate with a minimum periodic run time of 200ms. From the distributed nature of the controlproblem, certain tasks, such as state estimationand state communication, run at higher fre-quency.Message size must be small due to bandwidthlimitations, therefore, vehicles cannot share de-tailed information such as UTM path waypoints,dynamic model used for prediction, or captureset parameterizations. Thus, the algorithm isdesigned such that memory intensive tasks arehandled only on the local vehicle. We provide ahigh level software diagram in Figure 9.The driver has the ability override automaticcontrol commands by pressing either the brakeor throttle pedal beyond a configurable threshold.However, ICA can no longer guarantee collisionavoidance in the event of driver override.(a)(b)(c)Fig. 8. An example two-vehicle configuration is given at time?t > 0. In (a), we see that vehicle 1 is close to the intersection witha low velocity, while vehicle 2 is far away with high velocity.In (b), the flow is on the lower boundary of the capture setC(¦Õ2(?t,(x,v),u)) at time ?t, at which point control evaluates tou¡þ= (uH,uL). As can be seen in the bottom figures, the controlsignal u is equal to u¡þfor all time t ¡Ý?t until vehicle 1 has passedthrough the intersection.B. EstimationFor local vehicle state estimation, we employa Hybrid Kalman Filter (details can be foundin [21]), which combines measurements and aninternal state model to estimate the current lon-gitudinal state by minimizing the mean-squarederror. The filter is also used to construct trajec-tory predictions over a configurable finite-timehorizon, which are needed in control evaluation.The internal state model is learned o¡þ-line fromexperimental data trials, using a weighted leastsquares approach. The filter constructs predic-Fig. 9. Overview of ICA software modules, where the super-script L denotes the local vehicle and the superscript R denotesthe remote vehicle. On the far left, the Hybrid Kalman Filtermodule comprises the estimator, where noisy measurementstaken from DGPSand CAN are used to construct a state estimate.The state communication module is used to send local stateinformation and receive remote state information. The controlmodule uses the state of the entire system to determine if andwhat control action shall be taken to avoid collisions. If controlaction u¡þ is commanded by the control module, the controlhandshake module is utilized to make sure the vehicles agreeon the control action to be taken. The local output uL¡þ of thisnegotiation is sent to the local actuator for control application.tions at a rate of 40 ms, due to the low computa-tional burden and the need for state estimates tobe as current as possible. Correction steps occurevery 100 ms, corresponding to the update rateof the DGPS device.C. CommunicationThe wireless V2V DSRC is comprised of twomajor modules: communication of state informa-tion and communication of control information.State information is sent between vehicles todetermine if automatic control action need betaken to prevent a collision. The state informa-tion sent is comprised of: (1) The longitudinalstate of the local vehicle along with the cur-rent absolute time; (2) The predicted trajectoryof the local vehicle state over a finite-horizon(configurable); (3) Bad set bounds for the localvehicle path; (4) Dynamic model for capture setconstruction.When automatic control is evaluated by thecontrol module, a wireless V2V DSRC hand-shake mechanism is utilized to guarantee bothvehicles agree on the automatic control. Thismodule serves a critical failsafe function, as twovehicles may not necessarily evaluate controlsimultaneously, which is an unfortunate artifactof the distributed nature of the control problem.Once the handshake module reaches agreementwith the remote vehicle, a control command issent to the local vehicle actuators for automaticcontrol application.D. ControlAs mentioned in Section IV-B, control evalua-tion is determined completely by the capture set.If the current displacement of the two-vehiclesystem at time t ¡Ý0, given by ¦Õ1(t,(x,v),u) ¡ÊX,is on the boundary of the capture set C(v), thencontrol must be applied. If this is not the case,no control is needed. In this section we introducethe algorithms used to compute the capture set,and the logic used to determine control action.It can be shown that the longitudinal dynamicsused to describe each vehicle generate orderpreserving systems. In [6], it has been shownthat the capture set C(v) can be computed using aback propagation algorithm of linear complexitywith respect to system state. This algorithm isbased on the computation of two sets, calledrestricted capture sets C(v,u¡þ), which are definedto be the capture set when the input is fixedto u¡þ ¡ÊU for all time. Rather than providingalgorithmic details, we introduce a visualizationof the algorithm in Figure 10.Control action can be uniquely determinedby checking membership of the state¦Õ1(t,(x,v),u) ¡Ê X and the prediction¦Õ1(t + ¦Ä,(x,v),u) ¡Ê X within the capturesets C(¦Õ2(t,(x,v),u)) and C(¦Õ2(t + ¦Ä,(x,v),u))respectively. The choice of control will dependon whether the flow is on the upper orlower boundary of the capture set. In eachcase, evasive control will involve one vehicleapplying a maximum brake torque input, withthe second vehicle applying a maximum throttletorque input. The automatic control turns o¡þon-board both vehicles after either vehicle haspassed through the intersection.(a) (b)(c)Fig. 10. Algorithm used to compute the capture set C(v)in real time with an integration time step of Ts. In (a), thecomputation of the restricted capture set C(v,(uH,uL)) is depictedas a family of blue rectangles. In (b), the computation ofthe restricted capture set C(v,(uL,uH)) is shown as a familyof green rectangles. In (c), the capture set is computed asC(v) = C(v,(uH,uL))¡ÉC(v,(uL,uH)). The black outline representsthe capture set C(v) as the time step Ts used in the computationthe restricted capture sets is taken to 0.VI. Experimental SetupAll experiments are carried out on a testtrack at the Toyota Technical Center (TTC) inAnn Arbor, Michigan. In particular, we run theexperiment on a section of the track containingtwo merging paths. A schematic of the layout isprovided in Figure 11.Both vehicles run ICA as they approach theintersection. The velocity of approach is notfixed, however must be within safe limits. Eachpath is stored as a list of UTM co-ordinates onthe respective vehicle. The speed limits for path1 are vmin = 0 MPH and vmax = 25 MPH, whilethe speed limits for path 2 are vmin = 20 MPHand vmax = 40 MPH. The bad set parameterschosen are L1 = 55 m, L2 = 75 m, U1 = 65 mand U2 = 85 m.The maximum brake uL input and maximumthrottle uH input were chosen independently foreach vehicle such that the vehicle did not ac-(a)(b)Fig. 11. Pictures of the test track section at TTC (Ann Arbor,Michigan) used for testing, where (a) is top down, and (b) isa side profile. All experiments carried out use this intersectiontopology. The paths are shown as colored dotted lines, and thebad set is shown as the red circle.celerate in a potentially unsafe manner. Duringexperimentation, drivers can override automaticcontrol commands for safety purposes.The testing procedure is provided as a seriesof steps:1) Start the application at rest;2) Accelerate each vehicle to a reasonablecruising velocity;3) Upon automatic control activation, driverdoes not cancel commands;4) Once one vehicle passes through the inter-section, automatic control is disabled andthe drivers bring the vehicles to a stop.VII. Experimental ResultsWe now provide experimental results from atrial conducted at the TTC test track, as de-scribed in Section VI. The safety of the systemis verified in the experiment by checking that thetrajectory ¦Õ1(R+,(x,v),u) has empty intersectionwith the bad set B. In addition, the adherence tothe speed limits can be verified by checking thatthe velocity of each vehicle is within the interval[vmin,vmax] for all time.The experimental data provided correspondsto a scenario where vehicle 1 has entered theintersection at low velocity, such as a driverturning right on red, and neglected to checkfor oncoming tra¡þc. The solution is maximumthrottle control uH applied to vehicle 1, andmaximum brake control uL applied to vehicle 2.In Figure 12, we provide four snap shots of theevolution of the system as seen in the set of twovehicle longitudinal displacement (left) and fromthe top-down world-view perspective. In Figure13, signals depicting the dynamic evolution ofeach vehicle are provided for both vehicles.Note that the speed limits, represented as blacklines in the velocity signal subplots, are neverviolated by automatic control application. Untilautomatic control is applied at 18.6 seconds, allvehicle inputs are provided by the drivers. Afterthe collision is avoided (after one vehicle haspassed through the respective bad interval), theautomatic control was terminated and the driversresumed applying nominal inputs.VIII. ConclusionIn this paper, we have provided experimentalresults for an automatic control system capableof preventing collisions between two vehicles atan intersection. Data from an experimental trialis provided, depicting both the on-line algorith-mic implementation and dynamic evolution ofthe system as it successfully prevents a collision.In the future, we plan on including a humanmachine interface (HMI) for implementing awarning system. We are also working on imple-menting this collision avoidance system in caseswhere V2V communication is not available, aswould be the case if one of the vehicles did nothave the safety system installed [24,25].

 1  DESIGN OF ADAPTIVE LONGITUDINAL CONTROL FOR COGNITIVE CONNECTED VEHICLE  Ata M. Khan Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering Carleton University Ottawa, Ontario  K1S5B6  CANADA Telephone: +613 520 2600 (EXT 5786) Fax: +613 520 3951 Email: ata_khan@carleton.ca  ABSTRACT  Cognitive connected vehicles, when not under human control, will require essential features of adaptive longitudinal control, including the essential collision avoidance capability. The control system design integrates intelligent technology and abstracted human factors. This paper presents a model for aiding the design of an adaptive longitudinal control system that meets these criteria. The cognitive vehicle is expected to have the capability of information on location and distance between vehicles obtained on-line. In off-line research, simulation techniques can be used for this purpose. This information is combined with Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian statistical model for the identification of condition and the optimal course of active safety action that require deceleration for avoiding rear collision or acceleration for attaining the target distance from the leading vehicle. This model has the capability of smooth operation in longitudinal control in order to avoid abrupt speed changes in vehicle-following operating mode. The model structure and algorithm are presented and an illustrative example is provided. The longitudinal control system is mainly intended for on-line use in actual driving conditions. Also, it can be used in off-line safety and traffic flow studies in association with microsimulators of traffic.   Key Topics: 6(b) Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, 7(e) Human-vehicle interfaces Key Words: Cognitive vehicle, connected vehicle, safety, vehicle control, Bayesian, Monte Carlo. Paper Type: Scientific Region: North America  INTRODUCTION  The longitudinal control is intended to enhance safety and also it can serve as an instrument for attaining efficiency in traffic flow and minimizing fuel consumption and emissions. While meeting other objectives is useful, improving safety through longitudinal control will be a major achievement. Statistics indicate that a high proportion of road traffic accidents are rear crashes, caused by a number of factors, including distracted driving.  Also, side-swipe accidents are noted to be a cause for concern. Some driver actions that contribute to these crashes are lane departure, lane changing and merging manoeuvres. The safety problem is expected to get worse, given the growing trend of in-vehicle devices with potential for creating driver distraction.   2 It is a major challenge to eliminate driver distraction caused by in-vehicle components of intelligent transportation systems (e.g., a navigation system). While these serve useful functions, there are concerns that under complex and demanding driving conditions, these could be the source of driver distraction and might contribute to rear and other collisions. For this reason, safety effects of new technologies are of growing interest in OECD countries and elsewhere around the world (1).  There are two approaches to addressing rear and side collisions. When the control of the vehicle remains with the driver, a reliable collision warning system will help to enhance safety. On the other hand, a longitudinal control system can be designed with active safety features so as to avoid rear and side-swipe collisions. Future vehicles are expected to have the capability of safe and efficient operations whether these are under human control or in the adaptive cruise control mode of operation (2,3). Further, the capability to operate in connected and cooperative traffic environment is also a desirable feature (4,5). These requirements become a part of the cognitive vehicle design attributes. Also, in the design of the adaptive longitudinal control, there is a need to reduce abrupt episodes of acceleration and deceleration. This paper describes a model that can enhance the design of a longitudinal control system.   TECHNOLOGICAL AND HUMAN FACTORS IN COGNITIVE VEHICLE DESIGN   COGNITIVE VEHICLE FEATURES FOR LONGITUDINAL CONTROL Researchers and policy analysts are now realizing that the full potential of smarter transportation cannot be achieved without a cognitive vehicle and views have been expressed by research groups on the attributes of a cognitive vehicle (6,7,8). In this paper, a definition is advanced that has taken into account current and recent developments in communication technology and the use of artificial intelligence in vehicle design. The attributes of a cognitive vehicle are noted in Table 1. Also, shown in this table are the features that are necessary for the design of a longitudinal control system when the vehicle is controlled by machine and when it is under human control.   Table 1. Cognitive vehicle features for human and machine control Cognitive vehicle features Features for human control Features for adaptive longitudinal control system Awareness of position and surroundings X X Ability to gather data and send out data X X Ability to process data X X Ability to cooperate/collaborate X X Communication for active safety  X Informs the driver about situations (warnings, advice) X  Diagnostic capability X X In case of crash, capability to send and receive information X X Ability to provide non-distractive user interface X X Infotainment capability    3  To further elaborate on the cognitive vehicle features that are required for the design of the longitudinal control system, the following requirements should be met.  Ability to measure distance between vehicles on a real-time basis and to define critical distance for making an emergency stop under dynamic traffic, road and environmental conditions.  Self calibration capability in the driving environment that exhibits a number of uncertainties, for updating the probability of knowing the correct distance between vehicles vis-¨¤-vis the safe stopping distance in case of an emergency.  In situations requiring deceleration, deciding when to take corrective action and the level of deceleration (i.e. no deceleration required, normal deceleration, emergency deceleration necessary).  In situations requiring acceleration in order to reach the target safe distance to the leading vehicle, deciding when to take corrective action and the level of acceleration (i.e., no acceleration, normal acceleration, and high acceleration).  GOING BEYOND THE PRESENT ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL If the subject vehicle is following another vehicle which is not operating under longitudinal control, or if a vehicle from a neighbouring lane cuts in front of the subject vehicle, the system has to adapt and to accommodate these demands. Adaptive cruise control designs have been advanced and some high-end model vehicles feature such equipment. However, there is a need to improve the mode of adaptation to prevailing traffic flow condition so as to ensure safety and at the same time to avoid abrupt speed changes while maintaining a target distance between vehicles in the vehicle-following driving environment (2-5). Further, other design challenges of the cognitive vehicle noted in Table 1 have to be met by a longitudinal control system.    LONGITUDINAL CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN  The control system design requires operational details and a specification of the associated technology. In this paper, due to space limitation, the specification of technology is not attempted. Figure 1 shows the major functions of the longitudinal control system. The starting point is the estimation of a target distance in the longitudinal direction that should be maintained between two vehicles. Likewise, a target distance should be defined between vehicles in the case of lane departure or encroachment from another lane. For this purpose, a Monte Carlo simulation model is used. In this paper, the primary focus is on the vehicle-following task, but the model is equally valid for maintaining target side-separation distance between vehicles. For modelling the uncertainties of the traffic environment and control decisions, a Bayesian methodology formulation was developed. References 9 and 10 provide an introduction to Bayesian decision theory.    For on-line application, the location and distance estimation capability is provided by the cognitive connected vehicle technology. For off-line studies, the car-following part of a traffic microsimulator provides the location and distance data (11). Also, a driving simulator can be programmed to simulate the operation of the longitudinal control system. Due to space limitations, a description of these technologies and methods cannot be provided in this paper.   4 By using methodology, the system is able to identify driving states with potential for a rear-end crash. Vehicle speed, road condition and other driving environmental factors are used as a basis for this task. The longitudinal control model has the capability to automatically update key driving parameters, namely the probabilities of critical and longer distances, as well as the probability of correctly estimating distance to the leading vehicle.  The algorithm described later in the paper is used for the identification of optimal control actions. These are the timing of deceleration/acceleration action (i.e., immediate or wait) and the magnitude of speed change. In the case of deceleration, the options are no action, normal deceleration and emergency deceleration. In the case of acceleration, the options are no action, normal acceleration, and somewhat higher acceleration.                            SPEED CHANGE AND SPEED ADAPTATION DISTANCES  DRIVING MISSION During the driving mission, the system has to estimate safe target separation distance between vehicles and also the critical distance (dc) for emergency stopping. This applies in the longitudinal direction under the car-following environment. Likewise, in order to avoid side-swipes, the safe distance between the envelopes of vehicles has to be known. These have to be compared with the available distances on a real-time basis. A Monte Carlo model reported by Khan et al is used to establish the distance for driver alerts and the probability of safety margins (11).                                                                                                                                                            Figure 1.

The time headway of 2 seconds results in 55.6m distance available for emergency stopping. On the other hand, stopping distance required for emergency stopping at 7.0m/sec/sec of deceleration amounts to 55.2m. Since this distance is considered to be reasonable for emergency stopping and it is approximately the same as obtainable if a 2 second headway is maintained during an average cruising speed of 100 km/h, this distance is used here as dc for illustration purposes. Initial research suggests that the following distances should be used in the algorithm for decision-making regarding speed changes: d1.5c, d1.25c and d1c.   Next, the probability of safety margin is checked by using the Monte Carlo simulation model in association with the normal probability density function and a standard deviation of 15% of mean distance. Figure 2 shows the probability of safety margin>0 obtained from the Monte Carlo simulator. The results show that at dc, in the absence of active safety intervention, there is approximately 0.5 probability of a rear collision. In order to increase the probability of safety margin, the designer can increase dc.      Figure 2. Probability of safety margin (freeway driving example)  ALGORITHM  The algorithm for the longitudinal control system is shown in Figure 3. It integrates location and distance data contributed by components of the cognitive vehicle, the probabilistic estimates of safety margins obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation model, and the Bayesian statistical method for decision analysis. The inputs to the algorithm and components of the system that provide these inputs are shown. It should be noted that researchers around the world are advancing the state of knowledge on the connected vehicle technology with the capability to locate vehicles, estimate distances and enable communications between vehicles. So, the inputs required for the longitudinal control system reported in this paper are within reach.  6  BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF LONGITUDINAL CONTROL  As can be seen in Figure 3, according to formulation of the algorithm, the longitudinal control system in the vehicle-following context can be deployed any time to perform the following functions:  Decelerate to avoid collision  Accelerate to reach the target distance.  Maintain the target distance to the leading vehicle Of course the transition from function to function is seamless and automatic under machine control.                               A brief description of the steps as well as an example application is provided below. For the sequence of steps, please see Figure 2.  Alternative actions of the control system are: STRUCTURING THE DECISION ANALYSIS PROBLEM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Figure 3.

It is the target distance that should be maintained. The number of states as well as the 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 multipliers can be changed by the designer.  The deceleration decision function is launched if the system establishes that the target distance of d1.5c may be compromised. Options for the timing of active safety moves are:  e0  early action on the basis of initial information  ew the waiting mode so as to acquire and analyze additional information on the dynamics of vehicle-following and then take the appropriate action.  Options for reading the states of driving condition are as follows:  r0 no new reading, if e0 is selected  rc corresponds to dc  r1.25c corresponds to d1.25c  r1.5c corresponds to d1.5c  The following active safety actions are analysed.  a0  maintain target distance  aN calls for normal deceleration  aE calls for emergency deceleration.  The longitudinal control system is designed to mimic the driving behaviour of the non-aggressive driver and therefore the target is to maintain d1.5c. On other hand, if during the course of driving, a lane change by another vehicle or any other factor causes the distance to become less than the target distance, the self-calibrating function used for computing the probabilities takes this mode of driving behaviour into account in the identification of optimal e & a combination.  Prior probabilities of driving condition states at the outset of the time interval are assigned by the control system (in the automated calibration mode) on the basis of a check on the distance away from the target distance. The designer can specify the initial or default values.  In the use the Bayesian model, the following methodology can be used to obtain priors. P¡¯(di) = ui/¡Æui and ui = 1/[¡þdi+k], where ¡þdi is distance away from d1.5c and k is a calibration constant.   For the longitudinal control, a selected value of k can be used. The priors for the deceleration case are presented in Table 2. It should be noted that the prior probability of 0.7 is an approximation of probability obtained from the standard normal density function by using a standard normal deviate of 1. The sum of prior probabilities is 1.0.    8 Table 2. Prior probability for longitudinal control P¡¯(d): deceleration case  Prior probability d1.0c d1.25c d1.5c P¡¯(d1.0c) P¡¯(d1.25c) P¡¯(d1.5c)   Sum 0.7 0.2 0.1 1.0 0.2 0.7 0.1 1.0 0.1 0.2 0.7 1.0   Reliability in recognizing the driving condition by the longitudinal control system is expressed as P(r|d,e) -- the conditional probability. That is, if the true distance state is dc, the probability that the system will recognize it accordingly (i.e., rc). If the control system is able to maintain a consistent target distance, the P(r|d,e) is high. This implies that the system is functioning properly.    If the environmental conditions including traffic are very complex and the technology has not matured yet, the reliability would be low. In the self-calibrating mode, this probability will be set on the basis of system performance.   The following is the formulation for the self-calibrating algorithm for finding P(r|d,e). Using the index i for r|d: Pi=ui/¡Æui ui = 1/[¡þdi + k] where ¡þdi is the distance away from the target safe distance of d1.5c k is a calibration constant that reflects system reliability.  If the vehicle moves closer to the leading vehicle due to traffic reasons and therefore the d1.5c is no longer available at a certain time, k is automatically modified as noted below. k adjusted when the vehicle is at d1.25 = e[k used(d1.5c/d1.25c)]   k adjusted when the vehicle is at d1.5 = e[k used(d1.5c/dc)]  This condition is similar to distracted driving and only a malfunctioning system can allow it to happen. However, for a well functioning system, k can be held constant, as was assumed in the example application. On the basis of simulation or on-line tests of the longitudinal control system to mimic a non-distracted non-aggressive driver, an appropriate value of k can be used.  For the example of driving on the freeway under longitudinal control, the conditional probabilities shown in Table 3 were computed by using a constant value for k. These imply a fair degree of system reliability.  Table 3.

As expected, the location and distance estimation parts of the cognitive vehicle will deliver a higher degree of reliability in perceiving distance headways as compared to a distracted driver.     Figure 4. P(r|d,e) for control system vs. distracted driver  The marginal probabilities required in the analysis are calculated as follows:  P(r|e)  = ¡Æfor d [P'(d).P(r|d,e)]. These are shown in Table 4. The posterior probabilities (i.e., revised probability on the basis of obtaining further information before taking action), shown in Table 5, are calculated as shown below.  P"(d|r,e)=[P'(d).P(r|d,e)]/{ [P'(d).P(r|d,e)]}  Table 4.

The values can be specified on a +1 to -1 scale, with +1 being the highest gain and -1 is the highest penalty. Other ranges can be used and also utility-theory based functions exhibiting diminishing marginal utility property can be employed for generating the G matrix.   Table 6.

For each e,r combination, the optimal action "a" and its  associated gain can be found. The steps are noted below. (1) G*(r,e) = Maxa G*(a,r,e) This requires finding the highest expected G by comparing the (e,r,a) combinations. (2) For each (e,r) combination, the optimal alternatives a can be found.                   G(r,e)=MaxaG*(e,r,a) (3) Now, for each e, the expected G of the optimal alternative is calculated.                   G*(e*)= ¡Æfor all r [P(r|e).G*(r,e) It should be noted that the purpose of this step is to find relative gains of additional data acquisition alternatives. Here, we have only one -- ew.  (4) In order to compare e0 with ew, the expected value of information for ew can be found as follows. Find the optimal alternative for each r -- call it ar. These have been identified above.  (5) Next, find the optimal alternative a' for e0 (i.e., no new information acquisition due to "do not wait" option and therefore under prior probabilities).                   a' = Maxa P'(d).G(a,d), the optimal alternative under prior probability distribution.              (6) We can find the optimal active safety action by using the G*(a,r,e) values for a0, aN, and aE in association with P(r|e).              (7) Next, we find the terminal value of ew.                   V*t(e) = ¡Æfor all r P(r|e)G(ar-a¡¯)  (8) If V*t(e) is not>0, the optimal strategy is e0 (i.e. do not wait for additional information  before taking the optimal action identified above.  The results for the deceleration case are presented in Table 7. These clearly show that if for any reason, the subject vehicle is at the threshold of safety critical distance, the system should not wait for new information and act immediately to take the emergency brake action. Recent research on adaptive (intelligent) cruise control system endorses this feature. For d1.25c, the optimal courses of action are ew & aN. For d1.5c, the optimal results of analysis are ew and a0. That is, the system should take on the monitoring function.                  Table 7. Longitudinal control results for the freeway driving example: deceleration case Driving environment Deceleration case optimal actions d1.0c d1.25c d1.5c e0 & aE ew & aN ew & a0  ACCELERATION AND TARGET DISTANCE CASES In these cases, the distance states are: d1.5c, d1.75c and d2.0. If the system is able to maintain d1.5c on a consistent basis, it will operate in the monitoring mode and no active safety action will be required. On the other hand, if the distance is sensed to be increasing, the acceleration case will be applicable and the following states will be analyzed: d1.5c (base), d1.75c, d2.0. The additional information acquisition options are e0 & ew and the active control decision options are a0 (maintain target distance), aN (normal acceleration) and aH (higher than normal acceleration).    The prior and conditional probability estimates for the example acceleration case are shown in Tables 8 and 9 and the G matrix is presented in Table 10. Since the marginal and posterior  11 probabilities are computed from prior and conditional probabilities, these are not shown here due to space limitation. The Bayesian analysis steps and equations are in essence the same as for the deceleration case. The results of the acceleration case, shown in Table 11, are logical.   Table 8.

(1) The longitudinal control part of the cognitive connected vehicle can be designed to reduce rear and side-swipe crashes in order to overcome the safety problems in driving due to distracted and/or aggressive driving. It has been illustrated in this paper that the longitudinal control part of the cognitive vehicle can be designed to mimic the driving behaviour of a non-distracted and non-aggressive driver. That is, the system can adapt to the demands of the traffic environment and yet maintain safe operating distance. (2) The Bayesian-Monte Carlo model is best suited for the design of the longitudinal control system part of the cognitive vehicle since it is self calibrating, it can formally treat the uncertainties of the dynamic driving environment, takes into account safe driving  12 features, reduces abrupt speed changes by searching for the optimal time for initiating speed changes and the most suitable magnitude of deceleration or acceleration. These features enhance safety, efficiency and driver comfort in driving.  (3) The example application has produced logical results and therefore provides proof of concept.

- 1 -  A LATERAL CONTROL ALGORITHM FOR AUTOMATED VEHICLES BASED ON THE DEAD RECKONING FUNCTION  Yoshiaki Miwa(*), Sadayuki Tsugawa(**) (*) Graduate School Student, Department of Information Engineering, Meijo University (**) Professor, Department of Information Engineering, Meijo University 1-501 Shiogamaguchi, Tempaku-ku, Nagoya, Japan 468-8502 Phone: +81-(0)52-838-2492, tsugawa@meijo-u.ac.jp   ABSTRACT  This paper proposes a lateral control algorith m for autom ated vehicles based on the dead reckoning function. If a planned tr ajectory of a vehicle is expre ssed with a series of points and a h eading of a veh icle at each point based on a m ap database, and the trajectory of a vehicle is approxim ated with a series of a pi ece of a circle between two points, th e lateral control is given by a series of a constant steeri ng angle, but it is not appropriate to practical use. This paper proposes a relaxation method at the discontinuous parts of the lateral control, and verifies its effectiveness with computer simulation.   INTRODUCTION  Much work has been done on autom ated driv ing of automobiles, and accordingly m any lateral control systems have been proposed and experimented (1). The lateral control can be classified into two categories: one that uses explicit references on roadways like lane markers or magnetic markers, and the other that does no t use any explicit references on roadways but uses a dead reckoning function like INS (Inertia Navigation System) or GPS.  This paper deals with a late ral co ntrol a lgorithm f or autom ated vehicle s with the dead reckoning function and a m ap database. Altho ugh a lateral control al gorithm based on the dead reckoning is vulnerable because it does not constitute a feedback control structure, there are som e occasions an d locations  where an au tomated vehicle has  to rely on  the dead reckoning-based algo rithm. The occasions an d locations include where lan e m arkers are  missing or they are complexly branching of f, when a vision-based autom ated vehicle is driving.  In this algorithm a planned trajectory of an au tomated vehicle is discretely expressed with a - 2 -  series of points and a heading of the vehicle at each poin t. The points are sparsely  located with a map database, and the vehicle passes each point with the designated heading one after the other. One of the authors proposed an algorithm for such a situation, named a target point following algorithm (2), and the drawback was the discontinuity of control at each point. The algorithm proposed here is an im proved one of the previous algorithm and the feature is that discontinuity of the control is eliminated at each point.   DESIGN OF LATERAL CONTROL ALGORITHM  The algorithm assumes that an automated vehicle has a dead reckoning function like GPS and a map database. A planned trajectory of the vehicl e is discretely expressed with a series of points and a heading of the vehi cle at each point. This algorithm constrains the locations of points and the heading of a vehicle at each point along the palled trajectory to some extent.  For the simplicity , the dynam ics of a vehicle is assum ed to be described by following equations:                                                                           (1)   where (x, y) is the middle of the rear wheels, ?? is the heading of the vehicle, v is the speed of the veh icle, l is the wheelbase, and ?? is  the steering ang le. If the steering angle ?? is constant and is not equal to 0, and the speed v is also constant, the trajectory of the vehicle is a circle or a part of a circle. Let L be the distance between two points, i-1 and i, and ???? be the heading at point i. The steering angle for this section, thus, is expressed as follows:                                                                          (2)  Since this algorithm, however, will provide discontinuity at the point i, a relaxation function is introduced to avoid the discontinuity, and a new steering angle is expressed as follows:                                                                          (3)  where t1 is the current travelling time from the point i-1, and t2 is the travelling time between two points, i-1 and i. This algorithm will be referred to as ¡°the new algorithm.¡±  ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ===¦Á¦È¦È¦Ètansincoslvvyvx&&&¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ= ¡þLl i¦È¦Á 11 tan¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡Á¡þ¡Á= 12cos211 ¦Ð¦Á¦ÁttA- 3 -  The other algorithm (2) will be is br iefly introduced. In this algorithm, a path of a vehicle is also expressed by a series of poi nts and the heading of a vehicl e at each point. As shown in Figure 1, when an autom ated vehicle, which is located at the origin with the heading of 0 (x-axis direction), is supposed to  drive toward a target point (x1, y1), and arrives at the point with the heading of ??1, the present steering angle ?? is given as follows:  211111 )tan3(2tanxxyl ¦È¦Á¡þ= ¡þ , where l is the wheelbase of the vehicle.

This algorithm will be referred to as ¡°the old algorithm.¡±   SIMULATION STUDIES  Simulation studies were conducted to show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, and for the simulation two kinds of paths for a vehicle, Example 1 and Example 2, were employed. In the simulation, the wheelbase of the vehicle l is set to 2.55 [m] and the speed of the vehicle v is set to 20 [m/s].

- 1 - Image Recognition Algorithm of Front Collision Warning System using Monocular Camera for CA NCAP  Tokihiko Akita, Yuya Yamada AISIN SEIKI Co., Ltd. 2-1 Asahi-Machi Kariya, Aichi, 448-8650, Japan TEL: +81-566-20-6349, FAX: +81-566-20-6526 E-mail: akita@rd.aisin.co.jp   ABSTRACT  Collision Avoidance NCAP (CA NCAP) was issued towards reducing traffic accidents in the USA. Cost reduction is essential for spreading these systems in the market and making this program effective. A multi-function front cam era s ystem appears pro mising, which can realize two functions of FCW and LD W in CA  NCAP b y one sensor. H owever, obstacle recognition apply ing image pro cessing is still a d ifficult ch allenge due to th e sev ere illumination condition in general outdoor environment. Furthermore, large calculation amount is necessary  for the recognition p rocessing, wh ich makes hardware expensive. We ha ve developed e fficient al gorithms ba sed on s tochastic co ncept in o rder t o r esolve these challenges. Optical flow combined with pattern identification based on statistical probability is adopted to improve the recognition robustness. And, structural vehicle pattern classifier was designed to make adjustments easy in case of recognition errors.   INTRODUCTION  More than 4 millions of traffic accident fatalities are reported every year in the USA, thus urgent countermeasures are requir ed. Therefore, Collision Avoidance New Car Assessment Program (CA NCAP) (1) was issued. Considering traffic accident statistics and technical viability, installation of Electric Stability Control system (ESC), Forward Collision Warning system (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning system (LDW) are recommended. However, the cost must be reduced in order to spread these systems in the market. Though a milliwave radar is generally adopted to r ealize an FCW at this moment (2), they are not w idely spread due to the high cost. As the system utilizing a front camera can realize both functions of FCW and LDW by one sensor, cost performance is high and it has promise in order to spread.  To realize this ca mera system, image recognition in general outdoor environment is a k ey factor. Appearance of objects in the camera image is fluctuated in driving environment due to severe illumination condition. Though it ha s been researching for a l ong time, it has still  remained a c hallenge. Then, dedicated image processing IC is necessary due to the la rge calculation amount, which cause high cost. To reduce the cost, efficient algorithms must be developed. Combination of general feature amount and statistical learning algorithm is often adopted as the recognition algorithm. However, its calculation efficiency is not so high, and it is generally difficult to cope with each recognition error. In this paper, considering these concerns, w e have proposed the veh icle recognition a lgorithm th at calculation is stochastically effi cient and ca n easily take measures for individual recognition er rors by - 2 - structuralizing classifiers, and the evaluation results are shown. This system detects preceding vehicles and estimates the collision risk. Then, a driver is warned if necessary. Vehicles are recognized by analyzing images of the front camera. The collision risk is estimated by time to collision (TTC) which can be derived from change in the detected pattern width or length of optical flow.   SYSTEM CONFIGURATION  System configuration for this algorithm is shown in F igure 1. The front camera system is placed behind a rear v iew mirror so  that a clear view c an be k ept with a w iper. Image processing hardware is integrated with an imaging d evice for do wnsizing and low cost. Hardware design matters are  not descr ibed here in order t o con centrate on th e image processing algorithm that is the main topic in this paper. This system obtains the ego motion states and driver maneuver such as vehicle velocity, steering angle, brake operation through a CAN network. The system detects information of the preceding vehicle position only by the camera image, and estimates the collision risk. If the system judges the risk is high, it warns a driver. Furthermore, the brake is controlled depending on the situation and confidence of the vehicle recognition estimated by itself.            Figure 1. System configuration   VEHICLE RECOGNITION ALGORITHM  OUTLINE  Abstract of the image recognition algorithms for preceding vehicles are explained here. The algorithm can be basically constructed by optical f low because it is enough to d etect only approaching objects in order to estimate the collision risk. However, pattern recognition using vehicle appearance features is adopted to separate the vehicle from background at a long distance. In the near area, vehicles are detected by optical flow in order to detect approaching objects more reliably without relying on the vehicle appearance. The vehicle patterns are searched in decr easing order of the  app earance freque ncy in the actua l environment to improve calculation efficiency. Confidence of the recognition is accumulated, and then the calculation of pattern recognition is terminated when the enough c onfidence is obtained. It can cut calculation time down. Collision estimation time (Time To Collision: TTC) is used for judgment of the collision risk to obstacles. It can be calculated from change of the vehicle size when the vehicle feature pattern is detected or from ratio of the optical flow to the distance to Camera and image processing computerVehicle state sensors(velocity, steering angle)Warning deviceBrake control system- 3 - convergence point (Vanishing Point: VP) when the optical flows are detected. The warning is issued, when the estimated TTC becomes below the threshold time set from vehicle motion and driver¡¯s response time.  The general flow chart is shown in Figure 2. Aft er capturing image of the front camera and extracting straight li nes, lane boun daries are rec ognized b y uti lizing knowledge of la ne markers. Pattern recognition is performed in the detection area of preceding vehicle set based on the lane bound aries. I mage p atterns w hich represen t feat ure of  vehicle sha pes a re statistically collected, and they are searched in the order of appearance frequency. Confidence of the recognition is concurrently estimated, and the search is terminated when the confidence reaches to the set threshold. When any feature patterns are not found, optical flows only in the near-field region are searched. When change rate of the feature pattern is detected, TTC can be calculated from the change rate. Otherwise, TTC is calculated from optical flow. When the TTC becomes below the set threshold, a driver is warned.  PATTERN RECOGNITION  Feature p atterns with h igh appearance frequency are extracted from i mages und er ac tual environment in advance. Then, vehicle patterns are searched in order of its frequency, and vehicles are recognized by combining them. Once a vehicle is detected, vehicle patterns are searched in order of confidence of previous detected patterns because the appearance should not change so much in the short time. Therefore, a degree of the confidence for vehicle classification can be obtained with small amount of calculation. Probability of reducing the calculation time becomes high.  Actually, extracting f eature patterns o f outline of vehicle s hape, tale lamps, head  la mps, shadow under the vehicle and tire shape, vehicles are discriminated by selective combination of these feature patterns depending on the situation. Generally, pattern classification based on                       Figure 2.

The recognition performance depends on the learning samples, and it is difficult to understand structure of the classifier. Thus, adjustment for specific recognition errors is very difficult, which means that performance assurance  is di fficult. Further more, t he calculation efficien cy is not high. Therefore, we structuralized the pattern classifier reflected the appearance probability so that the calculation efficiency can be improved.  Processing flow of the p attern classification is shown in Figure 3. First, calcu lation order is set. In the subroutine of ¡°Set operation order¡±, if the previous pattern is detected, permuting in order of the recognition confidence, the order is set. If the previous pattern is not d etected, default order is set depending on daytime or nighttime. They are judged by lighting status of a head lamp or lighting intensity of the camera image. For example, in the case of nighttime, tale lamps, head lamps and outline of vehicle shape are sequentially searched in descending order of possibility of feature appearance. In the daytime, outline of ve hicle shape, shadow under the vehicle, tire shape, tale lamps and head lamps are sequentially searched. These can be statistically set from  i mages in t he actu al environ ment. Next, acc ording to t he set calculation order, the feature amount to be calculated is selected and the process is branched. In t his case, the abov e fi ve fea ture amounts are  calculated along with the recognition confidence. In the subroutine of ¡°Integration of recognition confidence¡±, the total confidence Ct is calculated by the conditional probability (5), (6) shown in equation (1).  Ct = P(cv | xvo, xs, xt, xtl, xhl)       (1)  where, cv is a vehicle class, xvo is a feature amount of veh icle outline, xs is one of shadow under a vehicle body, xt is one of tire shape, xtl is one of tale lamps, xhl is one of head lamps.

Thus, if enough confidence is obtai ned o nly from calculated portions of t he feature amounts, the calculation is terminated, which means the calculation cost c an b e reduced. Then, th e subsequent f eature a mount is calculated af ter returning ahead and it repeats until the confidence exceeds the threshold or calculation of all feature amounts is completed.  Next, the o utline of eac h feature amount is explained. First, a  procedu re for calculating feature amount of vehicle outline is explained. As appearance of a vehicle from behind is nearly rectangular, after extracting horizontal and vertical edges by derivation, the histograms in each direction are c alculated and  candidate s traight lin es are extr acted. The candidate vehicle outlines are obtained by combining these lines. The candidate shadows under vehicle body are extracted as a rectangle w ith low illuminance in th e low er area of the outline. Feature amount of tire shape is calculated as symmetry pattern of paired rectangles with low illuminance. Feature amount of tale lamps is calculated as a symmetry pattern of paired red portions with high illuminance. Feature amount of head lamps is also calculated as symmetry pattern of paired white portions with high illuminance. These feature amounts are quantified, and the confidence of estimation can be statistically calculated by correlation with appearance probability upon vehicles in the various actual environments.  Figure 4 to Figure 9 a re examples of the dete ction image for various vehicles in various environments. A wide variety  of combination of feature amounts is utilized to the vehicle recognition depending on the appearance.           Figure 4. Detection image of                Figure 5.

Figure 10 shows the explanation drawing. Assuming that a preceding vehicle to be detected exists in the traveling direction of a subject vehicle, only optical flows approaching radially from around a focus of expansion (FOE) of the camera are detected. However, optical flows on crossing vehicles can be also detected by broadening detection direction depending on calculation power of the adopted CPU.             Figure 10. Method for grouping optical flows  Optical flo w i s calcula ted by  the tem plate matching method adopting the N ormalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) as described in equa tion (2) for the adjacent area of loc al feature points adopting the K LT method ( 7), consid ering th e calculation cos t and th e d etection performance as results of the evaluation for various methods. This tracking method for local feature points is robust for partial shadow or fluctuation in illu mination under th e actual environments (8).

Assuming that the start and end points of opti cal flow exist on the p lanes parallel to the camera image plane respectively, the optical flo ws can be grouped by using the following Shadow VP¡þtx2i x1ixvp¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ11111111221111,,,,NjMiNjMiNjMiNCCTjiTIjiITjiTIjiIRTale lamps Tale lamps - 7 - simple invariant C, which is derived from projection geometry. Approaching vehicles can be detected by grouping only optical flows that converge to the Vanishing Point (VP) and satisfy this equation (3).             (3)  where, x1i and x2i are x coordinates of the end and start point of each optical flow, xvp is x coordinate of a vanishing point of the optical flow.  Figure 11 shows the detection image of optical flows for a truck at a short distance. Oncoming optical flows on the truck are grouped.           Figure 11. Detection image of optical flows for a near truck  COLLISION WARNING  Collision risk can be estimated by change rate of the detected feature patterns or the grouping result of optical flows. If the feature patterns with high confidence are continuously detected, estimation time to collision can be calculated by change rate of the pattern width as shown in equation (4). In thi s case, calculation amount can be redu ced because it does not nee d to search any optical flow.             (4)  where TTCc is prediction time reaching to the camera, ¦¤t is time interval of image capturing for optical flow cal culation, w1 and w2 are widths of vehicle featur e pattern at th e latest detection and ¦¤t ago.  If enough recognition confidence of the feature patterns cannot be obtained, optical flows are detected and the estimation time to collision can be calculated by equation (5). As a value of the denominator in this equation has already calculated in the equation  (3) at the grouping process, calculation amount can be saved. In addition, compared with the calculation method using derivation of th e distance to a v ehicle, higher accuracy can be obtained due to no  influence from road surface condition.             (5)   where x1i and x2i are x coordinates of the end and start points of optical flow, n is a number of optical flow.

Therefore, equation (6) is derived to compensate it by using an estimation distance to a preceding vehicle. The distance to a preceding vehicle can be estimated from the road boundary (8) or width of the detected vehicle pattern. Though the accuracy is low at a long distance due to the resolution, error of TTC is small because the distance Z1 is enough large compared with hood length L.  ¡þ¡þ 11 ZLTTCcTTCcc ¡þ¡þ¡þ         (6)  where TTCcc is prediction time reaching to a front bumper of a subject vehicle, Z1 is distance to an obstacle, L is length from a bumper (contact point) to the camera.  The above TTC is estimated on the assumption that velocity difference between the preceding and subject vehicle is constant. If a preceding vehicle decelerates, TTC must be compensated. It can be calculated as shown in eq uation (7), if tw o TTCs measured in different timing are obtained.             (7)   where, TTC is a compensated TTCcc for deceleration,           ,             , TTCcc(t1) is the latest measured TTCcc, TTCcc(t2) is the previous measured TTCcc, ¡þt is measurement interval of the calculation.  When this TTC falls below the set threshold, a warning is issued. The minimum threshold of TTC is specified in CA NCAP, so they are set based on these values.   EVALUATION  Embodying the above algorithms, evaluation was executed for camera images taken in t he actual environment. For the evaluation regulated in CA NCAP, the i mages were recorded under the established conditions in our proving ground. The sample image is shown in Figure 12. The lane and the preceding vehicle at a d istance of about 50m are detected by vehicle outline and shadow under the body in this scene.            Figure 12.

One is the scenario that a subject vehicle approaches a stopped vehicle at constant velocity. The second one is the scenario that a preceding vehicle decelerates after constant inter-vehicular distance continues. The third one is the scenario that a subject vehicle approaches a low speed vehicle at constant velocity. CA NCAP prescription describes that these tests shall be conducted during daylight hours with good atmospheric visibility. Then, required detection range is 48 m in the longest case of sc enario 1. This means that the front camera with FOV of 3 0 to 40 de grees and resolution of VGA (640x480 pixels) can realize the FCW satisfying this prescription.  For the first scenario, the evaluation result is shown in Figure 13. In this cas e, as relative velocity to the stopp ed principle other vehicle is fast, a lon g detection distance is necessary. Thus, large TTC cannot be obtained, and the estimated TTC is flu ctuated at a long distance due to the image resolution. However, a warning can be issued 2.1 seconds beforehand that is the minimum timing defined in CA NCAP. For the second scenario, the evaluation result is shown in Figure 14.  In this case, the principle other vehicle decelerates. Thus, the TTC is compensated by  equati on (7) for the de celeration. Error for large TT C is l arge because low-resolution TTC is differentiated. However, warning can be issued at the minimum timing in CA NCAP. For the third scenario, the evaluation result is shown in Figure 15. In this case, as relative velocity is small, error is smaller than ones in other scenarios. These results show that this system can comply with the regulation for evaluation in CA NCAP in all cases.            Figure 13. TTC in scenario 1 of CA NCAP           Figure 14.

Then, it was show n that the FCW with this algorithm can comply with CA NCAP. This has the following features; 1. Calculation effi ciency is good because feat ure p atterns of vehicl es ar e sear ched in decreasing order of t he appearance probab ility in the actu al environments and t he calculation is t erminated in  th e pr ocess of  p attern se arch bas ed o n th e r ecognition confidence. 2. It is robust for illumination fluctuation because the recognition algorithm utilizes structural combination of various feature patterns appeared in the actual environments. Furthermore, even if any feature pattern cannot be detected, an approaching object at a near distance can be detected by optical flow. 3. Th e recog nition algorithms are easily adjustable for human and it is easier t o ta ke countermeasures for each re cognition error because the feature patterns of vehicles are structuralized. From the above features, a practical FCW can be realized at low cost.  For the  future, we wil l i mprove reliability of the v ehicle recogn ition by  adjusting thes e algorithms furthermore to severe illumination condition in the various actual environments. This will enable the FCW system to control a brake or steering of a vehicle. And also, further functionality expansion is expected.

KEYWORDS: Vehicle following control, Robotic wh eelchair, Operation lo ad reduction,  Stability control, Ride comfort, New transport support service  INTRODUCTION We consider achieving of stable following of the multiple wheelchairs as the basic system of a cooperative wheelchair, and we have constructe d system with sensor and control functions as a basic system of it [1]. In addition, we ex amined some driving modes for the creation of  new support services. We have implem ented the driving m odes and function e.g. a free driving control by joy stick operation, se mi-automated control for exa mple stop function by the obstacle detection o n a course, and auto mated vehicle following co ntrol of a preced ing 2 wheelchair. And then, we have been verifying their control and function by test driving. In particular, we have developed the control having ride comfort and stability with keeping a constant distance, even if factors affecting control (e.g. road surface situation, user weight and etc.) is changed [2],[3].  These researches are a part of cooperative dr iving and cooperative technology to the personal mobility which can move on the same level with a pedestrian [2], [3]. A cooperative driving is "a driving mode which adjusts action of a m obile object while running the neighborhood so that mobile objects, such as m ultiple wheelchairs, may enable it to  recognize mutual spatial relationship and each moving action for each mobile-object itself and may not occur the fault or danger on a driving using a sensor , a communication function, etc." It  is important for a cooperative to perform  not only the cooperative to the m obile object of an around but the cooperative with a m obile object and a passe nger and the cooperative with the driving environment of a mobile object. Especially a boarding type mobile object considers transition of m anual control and autonom ous control,  and it becom es i mportant sem i-autonomous control and function of hum an machine interface (HMI). Here, th e target of a m obile object which cooperatives is an elec tric wheelchair and it is pr emised on using it in a m ixture environment with human beings. In the future, cooperative technology will be considered if it becomes the im portant technology  for the personal m obility expected  as a trans portation device. We think th at cooperative technology w ill turn into important techno logy for the personal mobility expected as a transportation device in the future. This paper describes the vehicle following which is to the bases of the driving mode of a cooperative and experiments.   CONSTRUCTION OF ROBOTIC WHEELCHAIR TO FOLLOW AND DRIVING CONTROL  The robotic wheelchair to follow can im agine equipping of the sensor  which detects the relative pos ition to the  preced ing wheelchair,  the communication d evice for transm itting control information, a c ontrol device, etc. The control ca n imagine performing the stable vehicle following, keeping the constant distance for a preceding wheelchair. In the field of an automobile, Adaptive Cruise Control is among the systems which perform a vehicle following. However, ACC keeps  tim e-headway constantl y. Moreover, generally with an electric wheelchair, a road su rface situation, change of user weigh t (the vo lume of loads) and an  electric battery being exhausted, etc. have influence greatly to speed control. Also on the basic system which reduced the function to equip as much as possible in  this research, the point of following control being stabilized and realizing it being comfortable to ride in is th e feature. This time, this which w as constituted from a m inimum device f or a v ehicle following and obstacle detection as an example of a basic system is shown below and in Fig. 1. ¡¤ A mobile PC with touch panel(Viliv X70 : Atom 1.33GHz : for driving control and human machine interface(HMI) )  ¡þ A laser range finder (SICK LM S151 : front range 270¡ã, measures the distance every 0.5 degrees and detect of the reflectiv e marker, the error is ¡À 30 mm  (1 sigma statistical errors are 12mm), and response time is 20ms) ¡¤ Electric wheelchair ( ¡°TAO Aicle¡± by Aisin Seiki remodeled, with the microcomputer of motor control is equip in PC control.

The driving mode and function in the case of realizing the vehicle following to a preced ing wheelchair is shown in Fig.2. Fig.1 Example of device construction of the robotic wheelchair to follow 4    VEHICLE FOLLOWING CONTROL  To achieve vehicle following of the preceding wheelchair which is core of base system of the cooperative wheelchair, longitudinal control (speed control) for vertical direction and lateral control for lateral direction is required. As described before, the performance of devices such as sensor required depends on the control m ethod. We have de veloped a stable control by using som ewhat less infor mation with the deviation by devising control m ethod. As a Longitudinal control of vehicle (speed control), a control keeping headway time, and a control keeping headway distance are typica l. This study is intended to be used in the env ironment intermingled with hum an, it is d esirable that distance does not change  significantly, and a control keeping headway distance was selected as a control of speed. In addition, the present study, suppressed the effect of destabilizing infl uence on the control, co mfort-oriented speed control scheme is proposed, and has been adopted [1], [2]. Lateral control of following control used the tar get point following m ethod [4].  In this method originally, inform ation of orientation of a preceding wheelchair is needed, but it has achieved stable lateral control even if by using the direction m easured of a preceding wheelchair by assum ing a c ontinuous vehicle following operation and a narrow inter-vehicle distance.  This ensures th at we can  eliminate the ability to get th e orientation of a preced ing wheelchair. This control method is already proven in platoon control and formation control of multiple robots and cars [5], [6].

A lead one is an autonomous driving, and by vehicle following to such a high-perform ance movable body, it becom es possible to compose more at a low  price than a high perform ance movable body though the safety when driving is secured. In the e xperiment, the distance was set 70cm , and 2nd wheelchair was unm anned, and 3rd had passe ngers. As shown, the proposed m ethod has enable to stable control corresponds to changes of weight. By such a vehicle following, it will conceivable to enable a user' s safety, im provement in c onvenience, and reduction of an operation load.                 EXPERIMENT OF SHIFT AND DIRECTION CORRECTION FROM MANUAL OPERATION TO AUTOMATED VEHICLE FOLLOWING  We developed HMI enabling sm ooth shift and direction correction from manual operation to an automated vehicle following, and did these validation experim ents. In the HMI developed, following target detection is shown on the touch panel, and f rom the touch panel, passengers can select automatic-coupling or shift to a free driving from a vehicle following, moreover the withdrawal of the emergency from vehicle following is also supported by pulling the joystick fullest forward. Situation of shift from manual operation to an automated vehicle following of last wheelchair is shown in F ig.4. In this exp eriment, passenger tilts the joystick to lef t or right to adjust the approach of roadside curb and verified this function effectiveness.  This is function to change direction of  driving slightly by m oving the target point virtual by the joystick operation, and in such a situation it effectively operated.    Fig.3 Situation of following of multiple wheelchairs (A lead one is an autonomous driving. 2nd one is unmanned. 3rd one rides on.)6                 AN EXPERIMENT OF COLLISION AVOIDANCE  Furthermore, we conducted an experim ent that a following wheelchair stops by the obstacle detection on a course, and resumes vehicle following when the obstacle leaves. It is a function of collision avoidance for the situation that people pass in front of a following wheelchair as shown in Fig.5. In an experiment it was possible to stop with the corresponding to crossing obstacles during tracking, and to resume tracking. ¡¤ A following wheelchair stops by the obsta cle detection on a course, and resum es automatic vehicle following when the obstacle is gone and following target is detected. ¡¤ Even if operation of a wheelchair is manual,  wheelchair stops by the obstacle detection on a course, and avoidance maneuver is possible.               Fig.4 Situation of smooth shift and direction correction from manual operation to an automated vehicle following Fig.5 Collision avoidance when people pass in front of a following wheelchair 7 FORMATION CONTROL  The formation of platooning is considered as a one of application of  vehicle following as shown in Fig.6. The for mation of platooning ca n be achieved by shifting the position of a  virtual target point for the ta rget point following m ethod in  the sam e way as a m ethod adjusting the lateral position of a following wheelchair that was verified effectiveness in the experiment as shown in Fig.7. As a form ation control application, it is considered that the formation of platooning be changed to variou s shapes according to the narrow pass ages and squares by the discretion of a head wheelchair. For example,  in m useums the service is considered that the formation is changed to be single row when wheelchairs are m oving, and to spread when exhibitions are explained. Future, we intend to develop the service and control method.  As an exa mple of for mation control of thr ee wheelchairs, Table 1 shows for mation control flow and state tran sitions in the case of changi ng formation to the triangular platoon driving from the single row platoon driving, and in th e reverse case of it is shown in Table 2. By shifting the position of the virtual target continuously, transform ation has been achieved smoothly while driving.

 Collision Avoidance at Intersection Using Wireless Sensor  Shoma Hisaka, Yuuki Shibayama, Kaichi Fujimura, Kenji Onodera and Shunsuke Kamijo Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8505, Japan +81-3-5452-6273, kamijo@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp  Keywords: Collision Avoidance, Wireless Communications, On-board Sensors  ABSTRACT  In this paper, a dedicated on-board ¡®sensor¡¯ utilizing wireless communication devices was developed for the collision avoidance around intersection. Four wireless receivers of Zigbee are installed in the four corners of the driver¡¯s vehicle. Each receiver is shielded and has slightly directivity. These effects enable ¡®sensor¡¯ to estimate positions of transmitters, which is brought by pedestrians, bicycles, motor cycles, and vehicles based on comparison of four signal strength of four receivers. Positions are obtained relative to the driver¡¯s vehicle as combinations of four directions, near or far, and approaching or leaving. Since the estimation algorithm is focusing on relative values among four wireless receivers, the detection results should not be affected by the transmission powe r. On-board sensors utilizi ng vision, LIDAR and ra dar cannot detec t objects hidden b y ro ad fa cilities and other  v ehicle. Althoug h infrastr ucture sensors for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure cooperative systems can detec t such the hidde n objects, they are much expensive than on-board sensors. The on-board wireless ¡®sensor¡¯ developed in this paper would be an alternative method for the collision avoidance around intersections.   INTRODUCTION  It is serious problem that 40% of the traff ic accidents in general roads occur in intersections. Most accidents occur while a vehicle turning right or left in the intersections with other traffic participants as pedestrians, bicycles, motor cycles, and vehicles that approach suddenly from the opposite lane or closi ng to the vehicle. Such accidents ar e easil y caused b y tra ffic participants in the Non-L ine-of-Sight (NLOS) spot of the drivers. Thus, detecting the traffic participants in the  NLOS spot and informin g the drivers about approaching participants are widely studied and developed as driver assistance systems in the field of intelligent transport systems.  J. Ibanez-Guzman et al. (1), Q. He et al. (2), and H.Okada et al. (3) studied a s ystem using inter-vehicle communications that e xchanges an absolute position obtain ed from GPS with  each other. However, GPS has a problem that th e positioning accuracy is degraded in urban areas in which usually suffered from radio shielding and scattering(4). In the case of vehicles, the accuracy can be improved b y referring information obtained from gyro sensor or car  navigation systems. However, other traffic participants such as pedestrians, bicycles, and motor cycles cannot mount such GPS systems. As a result, the system is hard to satisfy a requirement of positioning accuracy for driver assistance systems.  Compared with such systems, autonomous on-board sensing systems using cameras, radar, or LIDAR are also developed. P. Geismann et al. (5) and Y. Huang (6) are using stereo-camera to detect pedestrians. In this system, region of pedestrians are shown b y a disparity map. K. C. Fuerstenberg (7) used laser sensor for detecting obstacles in front of the vehicle, and applied this system to d riving safety at intersections. Broggi et al. (8) adapted the method usin g on-board camera and LIDAR. In this system, the LIDAR detects obstacle and on-board camera classifies the objects whether it is pedestrian or not. We also developed a pedestrian detection system using monocular cameras (9). These systems enable to obtain a relative position of the traffic participants existing in surrounding. However, the onboard-sensors cannot detect traffic participants occluded by other vehicles or building.  On the other hand, roa d to vehicle cooperative systems can narrow down the N LOS spot by using infrastructure sensors such as cameras or millimeter wave sensors setting in high altitude. For ex ample, field tests of collision warning s ystems at interse ctions are  conducted in California (10)  and Mi nnesota ( 11). In J apan, field test of  collision warning s ystem in  intersections was done i n Tokyo (12). However, the infrastructur e sensors are much more expensive than on-board sensors.  Position estimating methods with wireless sensors are now becoming popular. J. Moriya and T. Hasegawa (13) studied inverse-GPS method on outdoor field. S. Hara and T. Ishimoto (14) are developed indoor positioning  system using signal strength. However, it solves interpolating model with non-directivity sensor and have many problems to adapt ITS safety system. In this paper, we propose a low-cost wireless sensor for driver assistance system in intersections. Four wireless communication devices are installed in t he four corner of the vehicle, and roughly detect positions and motions of traffic participants having transmitter by comparing receiving intensities. Utilizing the diffractive characteristic of wireless devices, our system can reduce the NLOS spot compared with other on-board sensors.     SYSTEM OVERVIEW  Targeting Cases for Collision Avoidance  Accident statistics (15 ) (16) suggest that thr ee major cases for accidents at intersections as illustrated in figure 1. In this paper, we would like to develop wireless sensing systems to avoid these three accident cases.  Case 1¡¯ is a collision betw een d river¡¯s right turning  ve hicle and another appro aching participant along the op posite lane. Here, right turns in J apan correspond to left turns in European countries and American countries. The s ystem installed on the vehicle det ects approaching vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles on the opposite l ane even when they are occluded by the large truck trying right turn on the opposite lane for an example. In this case, it is re quired to detec t approa ching particip ants fr om fa r distan ce toward the interse ction distinguishing among four different directions, right-front, left-front, right-back and left-back.  Case 2¡¯ is a collision between driv er¡¯s turning vehicle and crossing pedestrians. Both right turns and left turns shoul d be considered in this case. Since  pedestrians approach toward the driver¡¯s vehi cle from v arious directions in ver y near dist ance, it is necessa ry to detect  pedestrians crossing near the driver¡¯s vehicle distinguishing from other pedestrians walking on the pavement apart from the vehicle. It is also necessary to detect in which direction around the vehicle the pedestrians exist.  Case 3¡¯ is a collision between  left turnin g driver¡¯s vehicle and other participants as motorcycles and bicycles following aside the vehicle. This type of accident is difficult to avoid because the left-backward corner is the most serious NLOS spot for the driver. In this case, it is necessary to detect the situation that motorcycles and bicycles are following the vehicle in the near distance.  System Description  Conventional on-board sensors should have N LOS spot h idden by other vehicles and roa d facilities, and infrastructure sensors are much more expensive than on-board sensors in terms of maintenance and installation. To re solve those d rawbacks of pr evious systems, we propose wireless ¡®s ensor¡¯ to  det ect rou gh positions and motions of other v ehicles and  portable  transmitter for pedestrian. Proposed wireless ¡®sensor¡¯ consists of four wireless receivers which are installed  in the fou r corn ers o f the d river¡¯s vehicle to receive th e sig nals from th e transmitters. Positioning quad relative directions, distances, and moving status of other vehicles and pedestrians can be detected by comparing four sequences of received signal strength. This  approach is considered as a solving method for extrapolating model between transmitter and receivers.  From the abov e des cription, re quirements for the detec tion b y our  s ystem should b e summarized as follows: approaching or leaving against the driver¡¯s vehicle, near or far from the vehicle, four directions around the vehicle as indicated in figure 2(a). For effective detection, the device directivity relied on the direction of transmitter signal is recommended. Since the kind of antenn as is peak y at direction gain attribute, we implement sli ghtly directivity by shielding. An Xbee chip, in which Zigbee system is embedded, was fixed in a shielding box as indicated in figure 2(b)(c). Bottom, top, and three corners of the box are shielded and only a corner of the box is open to receive the signal from particular direction. The four Zigbee boxes are installed in the four corner of the vehicle in the step of implementation. In order to emulate the real setup, the four Zigbee boxes are mounted on tripods, and they are aligned aside of the four corners of the vehicle as indicated in figure 2 (d).  In the above setup, the open corner of each Zigbee box is aligned on the diagonal of the vehicle. Therefore, strength of the received signal should be the strongest when opened direction of the receiver box is close to the positioning direction of the transmitter, and strength of the received signal should be the we akest when opened direction of the re ceiver box diagonally opposite against the positioning direction of transmitter. The calibration and detection algorithm of the system are described in Section.3, and experimental results are described in Section 4.   SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS  Communication Devices  ZigBee is a protocol for a suite of high level communication using digital radio based on the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard. ZigBee is a wireless mesh networking standard that is low-cost, and low-power and it is suitable for  the ad hoc communication. First, the low cost allows the technology to be widely deployed in wireless control and monitoring applications. Second, the low power-usage allows longer life with smaller batteries.  The frequency band of the Zigbee is 2.4 GHz, and can use for experiments in public roads. In this frequency band, the electric wave is diffracted in the corner of the obstacle, and is reflected in ground. This me ans that the el ectric wave can reach to th e NLOS spot. The stren gth of received signals is actu ally depend ed on the situation, and it was confirmed that enoug h strength was obtained in our experiments. In official spec, the signal range of Xbee is 1.5 kilo meter in open field.    Generally, wireless systems have a p roblem of packet collisions from different transmitters. Since Zigbee adopts CSMA/CA for MAC protocol, the problem can be avoided. In addition, a Zigbee device can set the 16bit code to identify each transmitter, and this header can be used to indicate the category of participants as vehicles, pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles   The comprehensive performance of Zigbee architecture is discussed by J. Zheng and M. J. Lee (17). According to this paper, packet delivery ration of peer-to-peer communication in heavy crowded node situation reach to approx. 70% at 5.0 packets per sec. It denotes that Zigbee is usable as device of ¡¯sensor¡¯ in crowded intersection. In our system, Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of transmitting signal from a transmitter is measured in each receiver, and the distance and movin g direction of the transmitter can be rou ghly detected by comparing the RSSI with the calibr ation data. W e drew the grid to surrounding s of the vehicle r eceiving signals, and used collections of the RSSI in each grid point as the calibration data. Moreover, the direction of the transmitter is estimated by applying the particle filter to the received data.  Calibrations of Relative RSSI with a Normalization  In order to estimate the location from the transmitter by analyzing RSSI of four receivers, we performed calibrations on the RSSIs. Since absolute values of RSSIs should be fluctuated by changes of transmission power and environments, it is more appropriate to use relative values among RSSIs of four receivers with certain normalization. For the calibration, RSSI as absolute values are acquired in the data structure as shown in the following Equation (1).   ??(?,?);? = 1,2,3,4,¡þ20 ¡Ü? ¡Ü20,¡þ29 ¡Ü? ¡Ü29    (1)  ¡°n¡± denotes the number of receivers where indicates front-left, front-right, rear-right, and rear-left corn ers of the dr iver¡¯s vehicle r espectively. ¡°(?,?)¡± denotes the po sition of the  transmitter.  This measurement was performed in a static manner which driver¡¯s vehicle was put on origin of the calibration coordinate as shown in figure 3(a). In the experiments, we take measurement three times, but the average of the data is uneven and it is distant that take more measurement to even the data. Therefore, we defined approximate equation (2) of the raw data and deal it as the calibration data.    ¡Ý¨Q(?,?) ¡þ?log????????? = ¡þ?log??? + ?    (2) ? = ??????¡Ý?_ ???? _ ??¡Ý?????(?,?,?) The equation is according to assumption that the RSSI is proportional to the inverse of square distance. It is well fit under ideal circumstances and widely used. Example of raw RSSI data measured by left-front sensor is shown in figure 3(b). The coefficient value ¡°?,?¡± is mainly depends on the an gle from sensor because  of its directivity made b y shielding of box  and vehicle body (indicated in figure 3(c)). The results of correction attachment to the left-forward sensor data is indicated in fig ure 3(d). Using this smoothed data instead of raw data, filtering has robustness against indeterminate errors of calibration data.  From absolute RSSI , relative RSSI is obtained as equation (3), and normalized relative RSSI is obtained as equation (4).  ¡Ý¨Q,?(?,?) =¡Ý¨Q(?,?) ¡þ¡Ý?(?,?);1 ¡Ü? < ? ¡Ü4         (3)  ¡Ý?¨Q,?(?,?) =?¡Ý¨Q,?(?,?)???{¡Ý?(?,?),¡Ý?(?,?),¡Ý?(?,?),¡Ý?(?,?)}?    (4)  ¡°???{¡Ý?(?,?),¡þ}¡± denotes stron gest RSSI value among the fou r sensors at the position. Equation (3) is final cali bration data and it has r obustness against fluctuations. The usage of these function are described in next chapter.  Position Estimation Algorithm  For the stable tracking of transmitter, we applied the particle filter for the observation sequence of four RSS Is. Here, w e focused on the relative values of RSS Is with the normalization described in the above subsection. Since we assume calibration data as relative RSSI value, the observation data must also be a form of  relative RSS I. The absolute  observation RSS I dat a of the s ensors is denoted  b y vector  ?(?) = [??(?) ??(?)??(?) ??(?)]? as collection of data mea sured b y each  sensor.  ¡°??(?) ,¡þ,??(?)¡± is the obser ved RSSI data of each senso r same as ??(?,?), and ¡°?¡± is the time of The relative observation RSSI data is as shown in the following equation (5).  ?(?,?,?) =? ¨Q(?) ¡þ? ?(?);1 ¡Ü? < ? ¡Ü4     (5)  Using these values, we  construct filtering methods. The particle filter is one of the fa mous time-series filters of signal analysis. In this case, the state of transmitter location is denoted by  the state vector?(?) =? ?(?) ?(?) ??(?) ??(?)??. In this filter, probability function ?(??|??) is approximated by a set of particle samples?(?) =? ?(?)(?),? (?)(?),¡þ?. Each ¡°?(?)(?)¡± includes same elements of state vector?(?).  In updating phase of filter, a set of new samples ?(?+ 1) is calculated by current set of samples ?(?)and a set of  its weight?(?) =? ?(?)(?),? (?)(?),¡þ?. ¡°?(?)(?)¡±, which  denotes t he likelihood of?(?)(?), is computed b y the function???(?,?,?)??(?)(?)?. The performance of the filter depends on desig n of this function. We defined ?(??|??) as shown in the following equation (6).  ???(?,?,?)??(?)(?)?=? ??? ??(?,?){?(?,?,?) ¡þ? (?,?,?,?)}?????¨Q?????+ ?     (6)  ¡°O¡± is offset value to stabilize the estimation. ¡°¦Ò^2¡±is variance of assumed noise. ¡°a(n,m)  ¡± are weights for robust likelihood. These values are decided empirically.  The position (x,y)  in ¡°C(x,y,n,m)¡± is the elements of correspondings^((k) ) (t), and fun ction C(x,y,n,m) calculates estimated normalized relative RSSI value between n th and m th sensor based on the calibration  data. So actuall y, L(z(t,n,m) x(t) ) is comp arison function of the observation data and the calibration data.  Classification of Transmitter States  In this paper, the final detection results contain rough direction, approaching-leaving state, and far-near state. These are useful for rough recognition of relative positions between participants and vehicles. Though all of them are based on filtering of comparison results, the accuracy of collision avoidance system depends on tracking results.   The normalized relative comparison of RSSI in this paper has robustness against changes of transmission power, and the detection results are not so much affected by that, indicated in  Figure 4. This fig ure shows far-near state detection bases on normalized re lative calibration calculated by equation (3). Despite the differ ences of absolute re ceived signal strength, the far-near detection results are similar by using relative RSSI comparison. Actual experiments and effectiveness of this algorithm are described in following chapter.    EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  Experimental Condition  We carr ied out various  ex periments on field f or emulating s cenario o f accidents in the intersection. The pattern types of scenarios are more than 20 and each scenario is conducted three times. In case of existence NLOS area in a scenario, we conducted corresponding LOS scenario as a control experiment. In this p aper, we describe a part of s cenarios, which are corresponds to ¡®Case 1¡¯ the collision avoidanc e of approaching vehicle on the course of right turning, to evaluat e effectivity of the ¡®senso r¡¯.. In the experiments, we measured dynamic sequential data. These are typical example of accidents. We expect that ¡®sensor¡¯ can be applied to the other road accidents. Detail of this discussion will be described in the following section.   Emulation for approaching participants detection: Case 1  In the ¡®Cas e 1¡¯ of fi gure 2, approa ching participants are located in N LOS area at first. To  prevent such collisions, ¡®se nsor¡¯ must det ect the far hidden participants and determine the  collision risk using the information of direction and approaching-leaving detection. As an axis of direction estimation will be changed on turning of the vehicle, the axis must be based on the intersection and it was calculated by transformation of raw direction estimation (indicated in gradations of figure 5).   In the experiments, we move transmitter tracing scenario lines in the figure 4, and record RSSI data. In the scenario from (1) to (3), the start points of the lines were approx. 40[m] away from the observation vehicle. The observation vehicle was set on course of right turning. Rough estimation of directions is based on the tracking results. However, in NLOS scenario, a part of receivers are seriously occluded by road facilities (indicated in figure 6). This occlusion causes estimation mismatch. Our tracking algorithm must have robustness against this effect, so we construct NLOS estimation algorithm.  This correction algorithm consists of 3 s teps. The first step is determini ng the ex istence of occlusion facilities. This is calcul ated by likelihood summation of the filter. When sensor  devices are occluded, likelihood value indicates lower than non-occlude d case because th e calibration data is also construc ted in non -occluded field. Th e thre shold likelihood of determining is decided empirically.   In second step, algorithm discriminates occlude d sensor fr om non-occluded sensors. In this paper, this step is on the assumption that only one sensor is occluded by facilities in most cases of practical road situation. The occluded sensor is also decided b y summation of likelihood. Supposing the one sensor is occluded and rejecting its RSSI value, the algorithm calculates likelihood for four patterns.  The last step is correcting state detection results. According to previous step results, algorithm can determine occluded sensor, direction of occluding facilities and transmitter. The direction detection can be corrected by this determination. On the other hand, the approaching-leaving state and the far-near sta te are not determined. But since most dang erous NLOS scenario is limited to fa r-approaching state, we  consider that correction of fa r-near and  approaching-leaving state is not needed.  Figure 7 (1)-(3) indicates a part of experimental results of scenario (1)-(3). Signal strength chart is the absolute dat a of RSSI. The blue line in the chart is fr ont-left sensor, green one is  front-right, red one is rear-left, and pink one is rear-right. The 3 bars under the chart indicate detection results of algorithms. The top bar is direction detection based on particle filter. In the (1)-(3) scenario, it means approaching direction to the intersection. Comparing the scenario (1) and (2), left-front is esp ecially occluded b y vehicles in scenario (1) as discussed. It causes direction estimation error in fr ont-part of sc enario, but it re covers so on and discriminate direction of approaching from that of scenario (3). In a result, our ¡®sensor¡¯ could determine the directions, and approaching-leaving state.  Emulation for following bicycles and motor cycles detection : Case 3  In the ¡®Case 3¡¯ of fi gure 2, following bicycles and motor cycles are often entrapped into le ft turning of th e vehicle. Emulating this scenario as figure 5(b), we conducted and me asured RSSIs in the same way of previous chapt er. The start point wa s approx. 25[m] away from observation vehicle. This is shorter than scenario (1) and (2) because in the following scenario, not only bicycles but al so vehicles are  moving to same direction. An  axis of direction this  scenario basis on observation vehicle (indicated as figure 5 (b)).  The result of status estimation is  indicated in figure 9. According to this result, our ¡®sensor¡¯ could detect dangerous following bicycles and motor cycles from red-part directions. However, on the latter half, the direction estimation is wrong ((A) in the figure). There is are NLOS and reflection facilities on the scenario, but the RSSI value of left-back sensor indicated as red line is somehow lower than that of right-back sensor indicated as pink line. Normally RSSI value of right back is lower than that of left-back in this situation. To prevent this estimation error, we must clarify the cause of this effect and solve it by sensor configuration and algorithm.   Evaluation of position estimating accuracy  For implementation of collision prediction, posit ion estimation based on filtering  results is thought to be useful. In this section, we examine the possibility of this estimation.   In the experiments, we attached board marker to the bicycle with transmitter. Assuming that the bicycle is per fectly following the course o f scenario, we tak e video s of scen arios b y synchronized camera and calculate the sequential position of bic ycle (indicated in figure 8). The accuracy of this calculation is estimated by resolution of video images and configuration of installation. In scenario(1)-(3), one camera has capturing approx. 30[m] length of course and have 720*480[pixel] resolution, so the ideal accuracy is approx. 40[mm]. While many types of noises are added to this data, it still has enough accuracy for extracting a ground truth trajectory of the transmitter.  Figure 9 indicates trajectories of estimation results and correct position data gathered by video images in scenario (1).  The outline of two trajectories is roughly matched. However, position estimating errors are unignorable for elaborated collision prediction. We need more stable and accurate position estimation algorithms.   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  The system was successful in detection of approaching vehicles toward intersection from far distance, and also successful in detection of bicycles close to the driver¡¯s vehicle left turning. The appro aching v ehicles in opposite lane w ere su ccessfully dist inguished from othe r approaching directions, and also distinguished from leaving vehicles. Though the RSSI value from receiving sensors are fluctuated by transmitting sensor and surroundings, the system can detects co rrect state o f participants. Besides th em, each participant can be identified b y identification code in transmitted packe ts under CSMA/CA protocol. As a conclusion, the  wireless ¡®sensor¡¯ was conformed as a valuable strategy for collision avoidance at intersections.  Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication by exchanging GPS positioning data is competitive to our method in Fig. 2 case 1. It is because that accuracy of positioning is less than 1 to 5 meters by vehicles with correcting schemes as gyro and wheel sensors. It can eliminate the GPS masking problem as multipath and no re ception of signals. However, vulnerable roa d use rs as pedestrians, bicycles, and motorcycles usually cannot equip such high-computational schemes due to cost and payload. Their accuracy of positioning by GPS should be degraded as 10 to 50  meters by the shielding in urban areas surrounded by tall buildings. Consequently, GPS system is not competitive to our method.   In this paper, Zigbee devices were operated under regulation on transmission power in Japan, where th e max imum transmission powe r are restricted and it is lower  than that in other countries. The system would be able to perform the d etection in finer resolution under th e circumstance where higher transmission power is available  The shielding  box  is desig ned for  sli ghtly directivity of  receiver.  Since  it is not final  configuration, the directivit y, which makes ef fects on accurac y of esti mation, has room for improvement. We cannot check all of proposition for design in the real world due to restriction of times. There fore our next step is desig n box and vehicle config uration on the basis of  electromagnetic wave simulations such as FDTD method. By constructing diffusion models of each scenario, our algorithm can also improve.   REFERENCES  (1) J. I banez-Guzman, S. L efevre, A. Mokk adem, and S.

 -1- DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGENCY DRIVING SUPPORT SYSTEM   Jaewoong Choi¡þ, and Kyongsu Yi¡þ  ¡þ VDCL, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, 599 Gwanangno, Gwanak-Gu, Seoul, 151-742, Korea   This paper presents an emergency driving support (EDS) system using motor driven power steering (MDPS) and automatic braking. This sytem is based on conventional CA system using automatic braking. For MDPS installed vehicle, EDS system can support the driver even if driver avoid collision using steering. When vehicle is in dangerous condition, EDS system support the steering wheel when driver intended to avoid collision with frontal obstalce with steering input, or the using automatic braking when driver intended to avod collision with frontal obstalce with automatic braking. The performance of developed system has been investigated via computer simualtion conducted suing the vehicle dynamic software CARSIM and Matlab/Simulink.   Keywords: EDS (Emergency Driving Support), MD PS (Motor Driven Power Steering), T orque Overlay, Automatic Braking, CA (Collision Avoidance)   INTRODUCTION  In recent years, automakers are trying to help drivers to avoid or mitigate collision called active safety system instead of passive safety system which focuses on protecting vehicle occupants in case of accidents. The practical applications have become possible due to recent advances in the area of exterior sensors such as radar, lidar and vision. These advances have opened up many possibilities for active safety systems like lane departure warning system (LDWS), forward collision warning system (FCWS) (1-6).  The further enhancement of these features will lead autonomous driving system which can avoid collision by automatic braking and even automatic throttle and steering. A challenge that these future collision avoidance technologies face is to decide when to intervene with driver and how to cooperate with driver to avoid collision. The emergency driving support system introduced in this paper is one of application for this challenge. This system does not determine high level evasion motion to use braking or steering to avoid collision. However this system supports the driver in low level determination.  This system is application that uses motor driven power steering (MDPS) and automatic braking system to cooperate with driver to avoid obstacle in front of vehicle. Instead of conventional collision avoidance system using brake, this system added MDPS control system to help the driver to avoid collision using steering instead of braking. The emergency braking support system is same to conventional CA system (3). Therefore instead of the detailed algorithm of braking support system, the concept of EDS system and emergency steering support system will be introduced in this paper.   2   DECISION MAKING  The EDS system should monitor the environment around vehicle and driver at the same time, and it should make decision to assist the driver or not. The standards for the decision are risk of situation and driver¡¯s action. To design the control strategy, the risk and driver¡¯s purpose should be organized and recognized by driver.  Driver Purpose Recognition  Driver shows four actions in emergency situation:  - Braking - Steering - Braking and Steering - No action  The controller should determine intervention considering driver¡¯s purpose. Considering limitation of sensor system, the method of evasion (braking, steering or braking and steering) should be determined by driver. After that, controller assists driver in low level.  The recognition of driver¡¯s purpose is another problem (7-8). To recognize purpose of braking is relatively easy however to recognize purpose of steering is not easy. Steering column torque can be a standard however disturbance of real system should be a problem. We assume that driver¡¯s purpose can be recognized easily.  Risk Recognition  The risk according to obstacle in front of vehicle can be expressed by inverse time to collision (TTC-1). It¡¯s developed and used in last researches about collision avoidance/mitigation system using automatic braking (9-10). This index can be standard for the decision making.  Control Scheme  The full control scheme is shown in figure 1. The decision is determined by inverse time to collision and driver¡¯s action. Emergency steering assist and brake assist works when driver uses it. If collision is unavoidable then regardless of driver¡¯s purpose, full braking should be activated for collision mitigation. If driver does not steer to avoid the collision, the strategy is same as conventional collision avoidance control using braking. When driver uses steering to avoid the collision, MDPS will assist driver¡¯s steering and additional braking is not activated by controller.   -3-  Figure 1 EDS control scheme   EMERGENCY STEERING SUPPORT  The braking system is same to last researches. The detailed control algorithms and equations are not described here. However emergency steering assist is new algorithm. The objective of this algorithm is to feel disharmony when the steering commands of driver is not appropriate for the emergency situation.  The emergency steering support uses overlay torque of MDPS to induce driver¡¯s steering angle to proper region. The concept of emergency steering support is shown in figure 2. To determine the support, the 4 issues should be overcome. In first, the danger area should be estimated from longitudinal and lateral position and velocity of preceding vehicle. In second, the appropriate evasion trajectory should be determined. In third, the activation condition should be organized. In fourth, finally control input should be determined.    4  Figure 2 Control objective of the emergency steering support  Danger Area  The center and width of back side of preceding vehicle can be detected using radar and camera. From this information, danger area can be estimated as figure 3 (11).  Obstacle AreaDetected PointCxCyDyDxP1P2 Figure 3 Danger area  The parameter xC  and yC  is x-y position of detected point and xD  and yD  shows estimated obstacle area. The parameter xD  and yD  is designed as follows:  20.8xv ehyv eh vehDLDw L¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ         (1)   Considering estimation error, relative angle between preceding and subject vehicles and safety factor, the obstacle area is designed. The 0.8 is approximated value of twice of tangential function of maximum angle between subject and preceding vehicles. Usually it is smaller than 0.4.  Considering relative speed between preceding and subject vehicles, the vertex points are designed  -5- as follows:  ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ12¡þ ¡þ0.5 , 0.4 0.5¡þ ¡þ0.5 , 0.4 0.5x veh y veh vehx veh y veh vehPC L C L wPC L C L w¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ      (2)  Instead of using parameter xC  and yC , ¡þxC  and ¡þyC  are used. These are predicted collision distance. If preceding vehicle is faster than subject vehicle, the preceding vehicle is not very dangerous even if it does not far from subject vehicle. The equation of parameters ¡þxC  and ¡þyC is  ,,,,,,,¡þ¡þsxxxsx pxpy s yyy xsx pxvCCvvvvCC Cvv¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ         (3)  where ,pxv  is longitudinal velocity of preceding vehicle, ,pyv  is lateral velocity of preceding vehicle ,s xv  is longitudinal velocity of subject vehicle, and ,s yv  is lateral velocity of subject vehicle.  Evasive Trajectory  The evasive trajectory can be derived using sigmoid function (11). The equation of evasive trajectory is  ()1 ax cBye¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ          (4)  where x is longitudinal position and y is lateral position and constants (B, a, c) are designed the trajectory to meet the vertex of obstacle area. The equation of constants is  ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þmin , 0.4 0.50.522log 1¡þ ¡þ0.5 0.4 0.5lane y veh vehxv ehx veh y veh vehBW C L w SCLcBaCL B C L w¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ     (5) where laneW  is width of lane, and S  is safety margin for the final position.  The yaw rate of evasive trajectory can be derived from designed trajectory. For the next step, the minimum and maximum yaw rate should be derived. The minimum yaw rate is derived using  6 designed evasive trajectory and maximum yaw rate is derived using physical limitation. The equation of yaw rate of designed trajectory is  ¡þ¡þ22 211sdyx vdxdydx¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ         (6)  The minimum yaw rate of present state is initial yaw rate of evasive trajectory. The maximum yaw rate is determined by road friction and vehicle velocity.  maxsgv¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ   where ¡þ is road friction coefficient and g is acceleration of gravity.  Activation Condition  Using designed evasive trajectory, the activation condition should be checked. The controller activate if the vehicle is in following conditions:  - Driver intend to avoid obstacle with steering - Rear-end collision is avoidable with steering - The vehicle is in dangerous condition (Inverse TTC is lower than threshold) - Driver¡¯s steering angle is not in proper region - Direction of steering rate and torque command of driver should be agreed.  First to third condition is highly related with control scheme of EDS. The controller does not make intervention with driver in high level and also it activates only when it¡¯s effective. A proper area of steering can be derived using minimum and maximum yaw rate. Using bicycle model, minimum and maximum yaw rate can be converted to minimum and maximum steering angle. Fifth condition is related with counter steer situation. Because of self-alignment torque, direction of steering angle and torque can be different. Then the direction of overlay torque can be opposite to driver¡¯s intention. It can bother the counter steer motion.  Control Input  When the all activation conditions are satisfied, then the controller supports the driver. The concept of support is shown in figure 4. If steering angle exceeds maximum, overlay torque makes steering wheel to be heavy and if steering angle is below minimum, overlay torque makes steering wheel to be light.   -7-  Figure 4 Method of emergency steering support algorithm  The MDPS overlay torque is determined by steering angle, inverse TTC and driver¡¯s torque.

SIMULATION  The proposed algorithm has been evaluated via computer simulations conducted using the vehicle dynamic software CARSIM and the controller coded with Matlab/Simulink. The simulation model structure is shown in figure 5.  Simulation uses multi vehicle model in vehicle dynamic software CARSIM. To evaluate EDS controller, driver model, MDPS model, radar model is used for simulation. The radar model calculates relative position and velocity between preceding and subject vehicle. The closed loop drive model determines the steering torque required following the desired path and the open loop driver model determines throttle, brake, steering angle without any feedback (12).   8 EDS ControllerOpen Loop Driver ModelCARSIM Vehicle Model(Subject Vehicle)Vehicle Global PositionRadar SignalCARSIM Vehicle Model(Precding Vehicle)Closed Loop Driver ModelMDPSModelRadar ModelVehicle MeasurementVehicle Global PositionHuman TorqueOverlay Torque Alignment TorqueThrottle, BrakeThrottle, Brake, SteeringSteering angle Figure 5 Structure of simulation model   Simulation studies are conducted in the case of severe braking of preceding vehicle on a high-speed. The initial speed of preceding vehicle is 90 km/h and subject vehicle is 60 km/h. The subject vehicle follows the preceding vehicle in 50 m. As the preceding vehicle comes closer, the driver in subject vehicle tries to overtake the preceding vehicle. However, in driving, the preceding vehicle decelerates with about 8 m/s2 from 3 second. Because of the hard deceleration, the maneuver of subject vehicle is not enough to avoid collision.  Figure 6 shows simulation results of the simulation.

The emergency driving support algorithm support driver to avoid collision using automatic braking and MDPS. Instead of intervening with driver high level, EDS support driver in low level decision. The controller support the braking when driver¡¯s braking is not sufficient to avoid collision or support the steering when driver¡¯s steering angle is not sufficient to avoid collision. The brake support strategy is same to conventional collision avoidance and the steering support strategy is developed and introduced. The steering support algorithm design the evasive trajectory and minimum and maximum steering angle using the designed evasive trajectory and physical limitation of vehicle. Using the minimum and maximum steering angle, controller supports the driver to have proper steering angle.  The EDS algorithm can be extended to more complex system using all-around detection system and advanced actuators like ESC, 4WD. The development of new index not only for longitudinal risk but also for 2 dimensional collision and new algorithms for the variable combination of actuators and sensors is topics of the future research.

Yet inefficiencies and inherent dangers of that system cost billions and perhaps trillions of dollars every year, as well as thousands of lost lives.  Automated Electric Transportation (AET) is a solution which addresses and has the potential to resolve many of those issues, particularly in relation to human factors in driving, for future transportation.  However, in developing this new transportation system, new challenges arise that must be addressed.  Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of the concept of AET and emphasize its potential impacts on transportation safety and mobility.  It also addresses specific challenges that this new transportation system will face as it moves through its development.  The discussion of these challenges, including deployment/transition strategy, environmental hurdles, incident response, and future expansion provides a springboard for further research and development in Automated Electric Transportation.  KEYWORDS: Automated Electric Transportation, Transportation Safety, Human Factors, Vehicle Automation, Electric Vehicles   -2-  INTRODUCTION  Reliable and efficient transportation systems are vital to stability and growth.  They sustain life as well as increase the quality of it.  Each year tens of thousands of lives are lost on America¡¯s roadways.  The majority of these lives are lost as a result of some form of human error, while others may be the result of environmental conditions or mechanical failure.  A cooperative transportation system has the potential ability to prevent thousands of fatalities and injuries each year, and has become a priority in emerging technological advances in the transportation arena.  A cooperative transportation system is defined as a system in which drivers, vehicles, and the roadway itself all function as a single, well-integrated system.  In addition to saving lives and reducing injuries, cooperative systems aim to maintain (at the least) and even increase travelers¡¯ mobility and productivity, thus further enhancing their quality of life.  Automated Electric Transportation (AET) is a revolutionary example of a cooperative transportation system which combines recent advances in vehicle automation and electric power transfer.  It is an emerging concept for a network of vehicles that essentially drive and power themselves.  Vehicles on an AET network will be controlled automatically via wireless communication links from vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and vice-versa.  They will also be electrically powered (wirelessly) by technology in the roadway infrastructure itself while in motion, even at speeds equal to or greater than current freeway travel.    AET¡¯s realization will provide unparalleled returns in the form of dramatic reductions in traffic-related air pollution, our nation¡¯s dependence on foreign oil, traffic congestion and roadway inefficiency.  More importantly, it will also significantly improve transportation safety by dramatically reducing the number of transportation-related deaths and injuries by directly addressing major current issues such as human error and adverse environmental conditions.  However, as a by-product of these improvements to today¡¯s system, new challenges will be introduced.  Among these are the logistics of the deployment strategy of making the transition from today¡¯s transportation system to a future AET system.  Other challenges include human interaction with the system, public adoption and penetration rates, environmental concerns, incident responses, and future expansion.  Although this paper does not claim to be an exhaustive list of challenges AET will face, it provides preliminary discussion regarding its future challenges, and proposes that addressing them represents the next step forward in building a better future for the transportation system of this nation.   AET OVERVIEW  The future safe transportation system of the United States, and the change required to achieve that system, really requires developments beyond what is now considered ¡°state-of-the-art¡±.  With human error and vehicle emissions contributing to the vast percentage of the number of annual deaths directly related to motor vehicles, significant impacts could be achieved through the synergy of motor vehicle automation and electrification.  Automated Electric Transportation (AET) is a step beyond current state-of-the-art projects such as IntelliDriveSM and current electric vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt, or the Ford Focus Electric.  Freckleton, Fishelson, and Heaslip  -3-  The basic idea behind AET involves the utilization of wireless energy and data transfer technology.  Figure 1 provides an illustration of the concept of AET, which is further described below.   Figure 1.  AET Conceptual Illustration. Currently, the energy that powers today¡¯s vehicles is most commonly produced by the burning of gasoline.  As a result, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (1), as vehicle emissions from millions of vehicles on the road continue to add up, the automobile is the single greatest source of pollution in numerous cities across America.  In fact, a study completed in 2000 estimated the health effects of traffic-related air pollution in Austria, France and Switzerland.  That report concluded that approximately 22,000 deaths (out of a total 40,000 estimated deaths related to air pollution) were due specifically to traffic-related air pollution (2).  -4-  Therefore, other technologies have emerged that are transforming vehicular travel, including the utilization of electricity to power a vehicle.  Although this provides significant advantages in reducing emissions, one major disadvantage is that electricity is difficult and expensive to store.  Hence, current fully electric vehicles suffer from range limitations on how far they can travel between recharging their batteries.  As a result, the adoption of these types of vehicles by the public is slow, as they are not likely to sacrifice their current freedoms in mobility.    Therefore, in order to take full advantage of the potential that electricity has to offer in vehicular transportation, it must move beyond stationary charging and on-board storage.  AET resolves this issue by offering the ability to deliver electric energy on demand, in real time, to moving vehicles using ¡°charge-in-motion¡± technology.  At least two of these types of technologies currently exist that provide highly efficient, wireless energy transfer: magnetic resonance coupling antennas and inductive coupling using a coaxial-winding transformer (3; 4).  These types of technologies would be installed in the transportation infrastructure, allowing vehicles to be powered and even charged while in motion.  This concept effectively eliminates the need for burning gasoline to power an automobile.  As a result, it provides a way for purging the nation¡¯s dependence on foreign oil as well as resolving today¡¯s growing concern with traffic-related air pollution in cities.  In addition, because the roadway itself is essentially a charging station, it allows for a significant increase in the mobility of fully electric vehicles, which will likely urge more widespread public adoption and increased penetration rates.  However, in order to achieve an optimum power transfer from the ¡°charging pad¡± within the infrastructure to a vehicle, variances in the distance between them must be minimized.  Under manual control, a person will not necessarily travel in a straight line within their lane of travel; for example, over the centerline of a lane.  They will typically wander to the left or right of that centerline, to varying degrees, while still maintaining travel within the lane itself.  While some energy transfer may still be possible under these conditions, maximum efficiency is only achieved through taking the lateral control of the vehicle out of the hands of the driver and automating that control.  This therefore introduces the contributions that vehicle automation provides for future transportation.  Automated lateral control of a vehicle may be achieved in different ways.  Among these include the use of sensors, or video cameras to track visual lane boundaries (white or yellow painted road markers).  Others include the use of Differential Global Positioning Systems or Inertial Navigation Systems (5).  The same would be achievable through communications between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I, which also implies I2V) concerning such data as lane widths, roadway geometry, and precise real-time vehicle location.  AET plans to implement this data transfer within its design.  With vehicles communicating their location and driving conditions to the infrastructure, the infrastructure could take this information and communicate critical data to another vehicle, or group of vehicles, on the same path.  For example, one vehicle communicating to the infrastructure that the road is slippery at a certain location allows the infrastructure to inform the next vehicle that comes along that adverse roadway surface conditions exist ahead, and the second vehicle may adjust accordingly.  Upcoming impedances, lane closures, etc. are also examples of the kinds of information that may be passed V2I and vice-versa which, if accommodated for properly, has the potential to significantly reduce reoccurring traffic congestion issues.  With this type of communication occurring, especially when coupled with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, longitudinal control (acceleration/deceleration) of a vehicle also Freckleton, Fishelson, and Heaslip  -5-  becomes possible to automate.  Speed adjustments and traveling maneuvers may be communicated and automatically accommodated.  This eliminates common human errors such as failure to check a blind spot as well as having to quickly apply the brakes due to another vehicle unexpectedly maneuvering into your lane.  As a result, non-reoccurring congestion also has the potential to be significantly reduced, and possibly eliminated.  Therefore, with AET addressing both reoccurring and non-reoccurring congestion, more consistent traffic flows may be achieved, and roadway efficiency would be significantly increased, particularly on roads with high volumes of traffic.  Finally, automatically adjusting vehicle travel according to the information provided by the V2V and V2I data transfer also has significant potential in reducing the energy consumption of vehicles and increasing the capacity of a roadway.  It allows vehicles to safely narrow the headway spacing between them, while maintaining consistent speeds, which will significantly increase lane capacity.  This may also be especially significant concerning locations with right of way limitations.  While capacity may be increased by reducing headway, with an automated system, traveling speeds may be safely increased and lane widths may be narrowed, allowing for higher speeds, more throughput per lane, and more lanes without having to physically expand the roadway.  Also, with automated vehicles having the ability to travel in tight platoons, creating a ¡°drafting effect¡±, aerodynamic drag would be reduced, consequently reducing the amount of power required for platooned vehicles to maintain consistent speed and traffic flow.  However, while the improvements in energy consumption, roadway efficiencies, and capacity are substantial benefits of AET, the greatest benefit may lie in the improvement of transportation safety.  In today¡¯s transportation system, even with more informed and intelligent decisions being made through advances in transportation technology, the human factors of driving are still inherent in the system.  With the vast majority of motor vehicle crashes today being caused by some form of human error, taking that factor out of transportation would dramatically improve highway safety, saving thousands of lives every year.   HUMAN FACTORS  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (6), motor vehicle-related injuries are the leading cause of death in the United States for individuals between the ages of 1 and 34.  That may be surprising, but is not unexpected, considering that in 2009 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported an estimated 2.217 million people being injured in motor vehicle crashes (7).  In addition, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) (7) announced that the total number of highway fatalities in 2009 (due to automobile crashes) totaled 33,808.  In light of those statistics, many efforts have been made to improve the safety of our roadways, and it has definitely improved over the years (8).  In fact, over the last 60 years, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has consistently decreased, as shown in Figure 2.  Also, although the actual number of fatalities per year appears to have remained relatively constant over the years, the actual ratio of fatalities due to motor vehicle-related injuries per capita has decreased by over 50% (9; 10).  -6-   Figure 2.  Fatalities and Fatality Rate per 100M VMT by Year (11). While a portion of the credit for the improved statistics over the years may be attributed to advances in medical technology, for example, another significant portion is likely due to advances in transportation technology.  Road safety audits have resulted in vast improvements in crash prevention as barriers separating traffic flows (in order to avoid head-on collisions) have been installed, speed limits and geometric designs have been adjusted, and sight triangles and sight distances have been analyzed.  Also, despite these efforts, accepting that motor vehicle crashes will still occur, several significant steps have been taken within vehicles themselves to protect their passengers.  Examples of these improvements include seatbelts, airbags, anti-lock brakes, crumple zones, traction control, advanced cruise control, and collision avoidance technology.  Many of these improvements have been developed, and many more will continue to be developed, as a result of analyzing crash data.  Various studies have been done using this kind of information in order to identify the causation factors of crash incidents.  Those studies have shown that the vast majority of motor vehicle crashes are caused by what is summarized in this report into one category: human factors.  One of the main safety benefits to automating vehicle travel lies in the results expected by taking the human factors out of driving.  Two common phrases used for the justification of some error or mistake are, ¡°nobody¡¯s perfect,¡± or, ¡°we¡¯re only human.¡±  Although no universally accepted definition of human error technically exists, the working definitions of errors and mistakes developed by James Reason (12) give adequate insight.  Error was defined as ¡°a generic term to encompass all those occasions in which a planned sequence of mental or physical activities fails to achieve its intended outcome, and when these failures cannot be attributed to the intervention of some chance agency.¡±  Mistakes were defined as ¡°deficiencies or failures in the judgmental and/or inferential processes involved in the selection of an objective or in the specification of the means to achieve it, irrespective of whether or not the actions directed by this decision-scheme run according to plan.¡±  In transportation, the objective is to move an object from point A to point B.  The means to achieve that objective involve the development and successful execution of a planned sequence of events, activities, or maneuvers.  This seems simple enough, but when you add in the millions of other points of origin and attraction for each individual on the same transportation network, and the millions of other planned sequences of events, activities, or maneuvers relating to their individual objectives, it is easy to see how any one error or mistake can significantly affect another agenda.  Freckleton, Fishelson, and Heaslip  -7-  Many studies have been completed in order to identify common driver errors and error-causing conditions in motor vehicle crashes.  Using data collected from documented incident cases, on-site accident investigations, and accident evaluations, four categories of incident causation factors were developed: human conditions and states, human direct causes, environmental factors, and vehicular factors.  A summary of common driver errors and incident causation factors is shown in Error! Reference source not found. (13).  Table 1.  Driver error and incident causation factors.   Upon inspection of the table, one can see that human factors (the two left columns) account for the majority of incident causation.  In fact, according to the study that produced the results of the table, it was found that overall, driver error played a part in 93% of the road crashes analyzed, as shown in Figure 3 (13).

Crash Incident Causation Factors. Considering these facts, it is clear that understanding, controlling, and eliminating many of the human factors of driving is vitally important to mitigating risk and ensuring safe transportation on our roadways.  Automating the task of driving directly addresses this very significant crash-causing factor in human error.  AET therefore has the potential to significantly reduce the annual number of deaths, injuries, and motor vehicle crashes, while simultaneously resolving many other transportation issues including capacity, efficiency, and traffic-related air pollution.   CHALLENGES  Although the concepts and end results of an automated and electric transportation system may be exciting to hypothesize, many challenges exist that must be addressed along its development path in order to validate it as a qualified candidate for future transportation options.  One of the main challenges of the AET system is that it is difficult to analyze due to the fact that it does not currently exist.  While the theoretical advantages of AET may resolve many of the issues inherent in today¡¯s transportation system, it is evident that throughout its deployment, it also introduces many new challenges.  It is vital that these challenges be anticipated and answered before its actual deployment.  Although it is not an exhaustive list of challenges, the following issues currently have need to be addressed.  The discussion of these challenges hopes simply to provide a springboard for further research and development in each of these areas of Automated Electric Transportation.  PUBLIC ADOPTION  In order for the public to adopt this new form of transportation, there must be direct user benefits immediately perceived by the consumer.  The most likely candidates for these may include travel cost, travel time, productivity, and ease of use.  Therefore, it must be easy to access and transition to automated control.  Once in automated control, travelers have no need to worry about surrounding traffic conditions, and they are free to use their travel time as they choose, potentially increasing individual productivity.  It must also be cheaper and/or faster than alternative forms of travel.  This new system must therefore be more efficient, more convenient, and, in order for drivers to trust forfeiting their control over their vehicle, it must be more safe than the current system.  Freckleton, Fishelson, and Heaslip  -9-  However, when talking about taking the control of the vehicle out of the hands of a human being, more challenges arise.  This new system must not only be safer than the current system; it must be far safer, and it must be proven reliable.  Today¡¯s system kills nearly 33,000 people each year.  An acceptable threshold for this new system, which must be much lower, must therefore be developed.  Also, in the rare case that a failure does occur resulting in a motor vehicle crash, challenges regarding liability issues quickly arise.  Currently, liability for motor vehicle crashes is managed through automotive insurance agencies.  It is the drivers of the vehicles on the roadways, who are also ultimately responsible for virtually all crashes, who pay for that system.  Because of AET¡¯s reliance on infrastructure and vehicle components, and because the task of driving is taken out of the driver¡¯s hands, it must be determined where responsibility for transportation failures will reside.  ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES  Previous vehicle automation efforts have feared an induced demand on the system, thus increasing the average vehicle miles traveled.  Accepting that fact also implies an increased demand for the energy consumed by an AET system.  This energy must come from somewhere, and the current option is likely to burn more fossil fuels (i.e. coal).  While air pollution from vehicles in the cities would be significantly reduced, the local pollution around the power plants would likely increase.  From an environmental standpoint, this may be a positive step towards improvement because one point source in a power plant is much easier to control than millions of point sources in individual vehicles.  However, the energy demand by the system must be less than or equal to the capacity of the power source, given its current environmental constraints.  Therefore, these demands and constraints require research and analysis.  It is likely that energy-generating technologies should also be incorporated in the design of the AET system.  DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY  One of the main challenges for AET lies in the actual change in the way we travel.  Previous attempts at systems-level changes in the transportation sector have ultimately failed in part due to an inability to provide backwards compatibility to previous systems (14).  It is for this reason that the transition from today¡¯s transportation system to an AET system must be developed in such a way that it provides that compatibility, and smoothly transforms.  It is acknowledged that retrofitting and upgrading the entire transportation network, including the vehicles that currently use that network is, of course, impossible to accomplish overnight.  AET will likely have to be slowly introduced and deployed in incremental phases.  One deployment strategy would begin with the renovation of some portion of the current infrastructure.  In order to analyze the feasibility of the system as a whole, it is proposed to begin with a ¡°closed-loop¡± system.  Busses, for example, travel along specific routes in a closed loop.  They begin from one point, travel along a designated route, making necessary stops along the way at specific locations, and return again to the point of origin.  America¡¯s transportation system as a whole, however, is not a closed loop with a few designated stopping points.  Full implementation would have to be piece-by-piece.  -10-  As an AET system requires changes both in vehicles and infrastructure, there is often a ¡°chicken-or-the-egg¡± dilemma related to these changes.  Do you change the infrastructure and let the vehicles adapt to it, or do you change the vehicles and hope the infrastructure adapts, thus allowing the vehicles to achieve their full utility.  It is proposed that this change begin with the infrastructure, which would be the next step in the deployment strategy.  Identifying locations where AET technology would most effectively improve travel conditions is critical in this step.  It is unlikely that the public will adopt the necessary changes in their vehicles unless they receive some direct benefit, as discussed previously.  Therefore, if critical locations are identified for AET implementation specifically related to those benefits, a faster and more widespread adjustment could be made.  Commuter links would likely be a good example of such a location.  If commuters were presented with a cheaper, faster, and more convenient option than their current vehicles, a faster transition period may be anticipated.  In order to achieve this, a single dedicated lane (similar to an HOV/HOT lane) would be put into operation along the critical link.  Dedicating a single lane for AET vehicles would provide a safer and more efficient transportation option that would also provide the user benefits previously described.  However, due to the fact that, in the beginning, this lane would serve a very small portion of the population, the lane might begin by allowing only qualified energy-efficient vehicles, such as hybrid, or fully electric vehicles.  As the popularity of this lane increased, a transition would then be made in which only automated electric (AET) vehicles qualified for its use.  Upon the success of this single dedicated lane along the critical link, the demand for this system as well as the number of qualifying vehicles would likely increase.  The length of the link could then be expanded, and in order to continue providing the full user benefits of the lane, dual lanes could also be added.  This expansion process would continue until eventually perhaps an entire highway would be fully automated and electric.  However, throughout this deployment strategy, until a completely closed-loop system can be developed, vehicles must have the capability of being driven both manually and automatically, suggesting the need for a check-in and check-out strategy.  CHECK-IN  In this piece-wise implementation strategy, until a vehicle arrives at the beginning point of the dedicated AET lane, or ¡°check-in¡± point, it would be driven manually, just as it is today.  Upon check-in, the system must determine whether the vehicle attempting to enter the dedicated lane qualifies for its use.  Allowing unqualified vehicles on the lane would defeat the purpose and benefit of the dedicated lane.  Also, as this process must happen while in motion, the system must be fast and accurate in determining whether a vehicle qualifies for travel in the lane or not.  Consequently, a rejection scenario should be anticipated and designed for in cases where vehicles may attempt to enter the lane, but do not qualify by either being a non-automated vehicle or an automated vehicle with substandard performance characteristics (i.e. low tire pressure).  It is also important to make the transition from manual travel to automated travel a task to be performed by the system.  Just as unqualified vehicles on the dedicated lane would defeat the purpose and benefit of AET travel, qualified vehicles that are still manually controlled would Freckleton, Fishelson, and Heaslip  -11-  do the same.  Therefore, the system cannot allow for the human error of failing to put the vehicle in automatic mode.  This process must be smooth and automatic, allowing the vehicle to take control of itself despite the actions (or inactions) of the driver to this transition.  CHECK-OUT  Just as a vehicle checks in at the beginning of the dedicated AET lane, it must check-out when it reaches its end.  One of the benefits of automated driving is that the driver is no longer required to pay attention to the driving task.  Drivers would have the ability to use that time to perform other tasks valuable to each individual.  These activities may range from sleeping, reading, watching movies or some other form of entertainment, or even working on a computer, for example.  However, it would be disastrous if a driver was asleep or otherwise not aware or prepared to manually take over the task of driving and they were suddenly required to do so.  Thus, the transition of control from automated to manual is much more complicated, as it relies on human awareness and ability.  Therefore, before check-out, the awareness of the driver must be determined.  Once the driver is alert and prepared to make the transition from automated control to manual control, the transition must be just as smooth as check-in.  The driver, rather than the system, should likely perform this task in order to ensure that the driver is prepared to manually control the vehicle.  Therefore, in the event that a driver fails the awareness test, or fails to manually take control of the vehicle, an exit strategy should be developed in which the vehicle is taken out of traffic until the driver is adequately alert and prepared to perform the driving task.  INCIDENT RESPONSE  A further inspection of Table 1 provides another insight as to the challenges remaining in the AET system.  Vehicle automation resolves many of the issues surrounding the human factors of driving as well as many of the environmental causes of crashes on today¡¯s roadways.  However, it does not resolve all crash-causing factors.  It is still possible, and should be expected, to have incident scenarios such as tire blowouts, animals running into the roadway, and other debris suddenly obstructing the path of travel (from a box falling off of a truck to a tree falling onto the road).  Hence, the resiliency of the AET system must be further developed and researched.  The scenarios described, along with their responses must therefore be addressed.  One benefit is that as these incident scenarios occur on an automated system, the reaction time for the first vehicle approaching the disaster would be significantly reduced.  Also, when that vehicle suddenly applies its brakes, the information can be passed simultaneously to all of the following vehicles, and each vehicle reacts in unison, thus avoiding rear-end crashes.  This fact alone significantly increases the safety of our roadways.  However, this leads to a point of concern in the protection of the dedicated lane.  In order to achieve its full utility, only qualified vehicles may use it.  It must be protected from other non-qualified vehicles entering at any point along the way.  However, if the lane is protected such that no outside interference from other vehicles is possible, that also implies the lack of an exit option for the AET vehicles if one of these disaster scenarios occurred.  Therefore, in the event that travel along the dedicated lane becomes impossible, there must be a response strategy for the vehicles in that lane.  Control must be given back to the driver to manually -12-  maneuver back into normal traffic in order to continue in their travel.  Thus, the dedicated lane must provide both protection from outside the lane as well as provide an exit option in the event of a disaster.  Another scenario which must be analyzed includes mechanical or technical errors and failures.  These failures must not have catastrophic consequences.  In the failure of power transfer to the vehicles, if some mechanical or technical error occurs resulting in an AET vehicle being unable to be powered or charged, and that vehicle loses power and shuts down, it would then become hazard, and an obstruction to travel in the automated lane.  Therefore, this situation must be avoided by either accurate, real-time vehicle monitoring along every step of automated travel, or by incorporating some redundancy within the system.  This redundancy would provide some back-up power transfer to the vehicle.  More importantly, the failure of longitudinal or lateral control would result in a catastrophic disaster.  If some mechanical or technical error resulted in the loss of either of these controls, a crash may be expected.  Therefore, this situation must not occur.  Redundancies in this area may include the use of magnets or GPS, as well as vehicle sensors, such as lidar.  In the event that none of these options are available, control over the vehicle must be immediately given back to the driver before an incident occurs.  The monitoring of these aspects will require the development of sophisticated software that provide real-time inspections of vehicle performance.  If any complications arise at any point in automated travel, an exit strategy should be developed in which the vehicle is taken out of the dedicated lane and control is given back to the driver.  EXPANSION  The initial idea behind the deployment strategy outlined in this paper is that upon its successful execution, AET will eventually replicate the transportation system of today.  However, it provides the opportunity to move beyond that system.  Therefore, the future of this new system must also be anticipated throughout its deployment.  Lane widths, for example, represent a specific area where adaptation may be required.  It would be uneconomical to initially develop a 12-foot AET lane, knowing that upon the expansion of the system, that lane could be reduced to a 10-foot, or even a 9-foot lane, and have to alter the embedded AET technology in the road.  Geometric designs are also of particular concern involving the future of the AET system.  As you move beyond today¡¯s transportation system, automated vehicles are anticipated to have the ability to safely travel at much higher speeds than today¡¯s vehicles.  However, the full utility of the automated system must not come at the expense of decreased safety measures.  Therefore, super-elevations and curve radii must be accurately designed for the AET system in a safe and sustainable manner.   CONCLUSION  The safety, environmental impact, and inefficiency of today¡¯s automobiles and transportation system as a whole is unacceptable.  Billions, and perhaps trillions, of dollars are wasted each year as a result, and thousands of lives are lost.  An immediate solution to the problems facing Freckleton, Fishelson, and Heaslip  -13-  our transportation system may likely be impossible.  However, by directly addressing these factors, the concept of AET given in this report does provide our nation with a solution.  Although significant financial, political, and technical risks are inevitable in a revolutionary idea such as AET, the societal benefits are monumental.  It would significantly reduce carbon emissions and air pollution in cities across the nation, as well as our dependence on foreign oil, traffic congestion, and motor vehicle crashes.  It also has the ability to improve roadway efficiency and resolve right-of-way limitation issues inherent in today¡¯s transportation system.  Despite these advantages, challenges surrounding this new system require further research and development.  Anticipating and resolving those challenges before the deployment of AET begins is critical in achieving a quicker and more wide-spread adoption.  This research in developing the technology required to successfully deploy AET should be a priority in order for our nation to lead the way in innovation, productivity, and quality of life.

1 USE AND POTENTIAL SAFETY EFFECTS OF IN-VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES  Merja Penttinen Senior Scientist, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland P.O. Box 1000, FI-02044 VTT Tel. +358 40 554 6826, merja.penttinen@vtt.fi  Pirkko R?m? Principal Scientist,  VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Tel. +358 40 561 0518, pirkko.rama@vtt.fi   Virpi Britschgi Research Scientist, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Tel. +358 40 549 3275, virpi.britschgi@vtt.fi    ABSTRACT If designed ergonomically and u sed appropriately, In-Vehicle Technologies (IVT) have the potential to significantly enhance safety, mobility and driving comfort. This study focuses on the us e and us er ass essment of common IVT  su ch as cruis e con trol, nav igation, spee d alert/control, and mobile phone. The data was collected by a standardized web-survey and included 76 77 drivers in nin e countries. The findings of the study  highlight so me cross-cultural differences in the use of the systems, especially in the use of a mobile phone while driving. In addition, some differences found between driver groups indicate that some systems are used most by drivers with high annual mileage. The possession and use of cruise control and speed control seem to correlate with driving experience, and also with the characteristics of the car fleet (age, make) in different countries. On the other hand, some systems, especially navigation, are widely used in all driver groups regardless of driving experience or age. This emphasizes the importance of user-centered design and evaluation in real traffic, especially since users reported i nteracting with the systems (even while driving) on the one hand, an d experiencing c hallenges in understand ing how the s ystems work  on the other. The questionnaire study formed part of the INTERACTION project, which now cont inues with naturalistic driving experiments and in-depth behavior analysis of the selected IVT systems. KEYWORDS: IVT s ystems, INTERACTIO N, driver behavior, user asse ssment, safety effects, cross-cultural differences 2 BACKGROUND The development of infor mation and communication technologies (ICT) in the area of road transport provides drivers with access to various functions and services while driving. If In-Vehicle Technology (IVT) sy stems are desig ned and used approp riately, the y have th e potential to  significantly e nhance s afety, m obility, and driving comfort (1) (2) (3) (4). However, little is yet known about how much drivers actually use th e systems, and how, where, when, and why drivers interact with them. In addition, the long-term effects on driver behavior, driving performance, and hence traffic safety are still largely unknown.  The main objective of the INTERACTION project (5) (6) was to identify patterns of use o f IVT by European drivers during normal driving. Also of interest were the long-term effects of IVT on drivers¡¯ behavior and skills, as well as individual and cross-cultural differences. The methodological framework set up to ach ieve these objectives in cluded focus groups, a questionnaire survey, naturalistic observations, and in-depth observations. This paper focuses on the findings of the questionnaire study (7).  OBJECTIVES The main objective of the questionnaire study was to investigate the self-reported use of IVT. In addition, cross-cultural differences in IVT use were studied in detail. The study focused on systems already in widespread use, namely cruise control, speed limiter, speed alert , and navigation. Mobile phone usage while driving was also investigated. The research questions were designed to cover the usage and context of use for each system. Also of interest were the perceived benefits and potential risks of using the systems.   METHOD A s tandardized survey  was se en a s the most cost-effective w ay o f in vestigating drivers¡¯ opinions an d possi ble cross-cultural effects o f the use of IVT s ystems. A web-based  questionnaire was selected. Data collection was carried o ut in eight European countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Holland, Portugal, Spain, UK, and additionally in Australia.   One polling company collected the data in all the participating countries. The study sample was drawn in each country from existing web panels (CINT panels). Pre-screening questions on driving and use of IVT systems were use d to id entify the targeted population ¨C active drivers and users of selected IVT systems. The target was to achieve responses from 800 users in each country.  3 The questionnaire started with screening questions to select the target group of participating drivers, followed b y more detailed  soc io-economic background qu estions and questions related to driving. System-related questions were put only to participants who had indicated in the screening section that they were users of the rele vant system. Participants also answered more generic questions related to use of technology and their insights on traffic safety.   To make sure the respondents considered the correct system when giving their answers, all the systems were described as follows:  1. Cruise control is a s ystem that automatically controls the speed of a motor vehicle. The d river sets the s peed an d th e s ystem takes ov er the thr ottle of the  ca r to maintain that speed. 2. Speed limiter is a system that allows the driver to set a maximum vehicle speed that cannot be exceeded without user intervention. 3. Speed Alert is an information and warning system that informs the driver about the current speed limit and warns the driver if he/she is speeding. 4. Navigation System can be built into vehicles or purchased separately as a personal navigation device or as  part of a Mobile Phone. It t ypically uses GPS signals and a map database to pinpoint the road user¡¯s location on the road system. It can then give directions to the road user¡¯s chosen destination.  RESULTS RESPONDENTS The final sa mple consisted of 76 77 driver s. The follo wing demographic trends were identified: Most of the respondents d rove 10 000¨C20 000 k m annually ¨C however, so me d ifferences (p<0.05) were found between the participating countries:  -  In the Czech Republic the largest share of drivers (32%) drove only 5 000¨C10 000 km annually.  - In Finland and Portugal quite a large share of drivers (16% and 19% , respectively) drove more than 30 000 km annually.   The largest group of respondents was 26¨C45 years old, the average age in different countries varying between 32 an d 48 years (table 1). Some differences (p<0.05) were found between the samples in the participating countries: - Czech drivers were typically younger than the drivers in other countries. The largest group of Czech drivers was 18¨C26 years old. - The older group, (46¨C65 years old) was markedly larger in t he UK, Australia and Holland (over 40% in each) than in the other countries (typically under 20%). 4  Table 1.

In the final set there was a slight predominance of females, as expected since the panels also included more females than males. Three countries ¡ª Austria, Portugal and Spain ¡ª had a predominance of males in the  final data, whereas all th e other countries had more female respondents.  The inter actions bet ween bac kground variab les were an alyzed a nd the following trend s (p<0.05) identified: - The oldest age groups had the lowest annual mileage, - Male drivers drove more than females, - There was a predo minance of males in the older ag e groups and of females in the younger age groups.  Consequently, when analyzing the cross-cultural differences in system usage, the variation in background demographics between participating countries needs to be considered.  USE OF THE IN-VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES (IVT) Possession of IVT systems in the sample All drivers in th e sample (N=7677) were users of at least one of th e studied IVT systems. However, some systems were used more than others.   A navigati on system was the most w idely used o f t he st udied sy stems; 88%  of the participants reported using one. The usage varied slightly between countries, being lowest in Australia (67%) and highest in Holland (97%). There were no differences between genders or driving experience groups in owning and using a navigation system. However, the use of a 5 navigation system decreased with age (p<0.01), being 93% in the youngest group (<26 years) and 76% in the oldest group (>65 years).  More than 50% of the respondents reported using a mobile phone while driving. Differences between countries were much more marked than in the use of a navigation system. Whereas 83% of the Finnish drivers reported using their mobile phone while driving, only 30% of the British drivers reported accordingly. Male respondents reported using a mobile phone while driving more often th an fem ale dr ivers (p< 0.05). The us e of a mobile phon e w as more common in groups driving a high annual mileage (p<0.001): 44% of the drivers driving less than 5 000 km annually used a mobile phone while driving, compared with 72% of the drivers with an annual mileage over 30 000 km. Use of a mobile phone also clearly correlated with age (p<0.001); 72% of the y oungest drivers reported using a mobile phone while driving, compared with 40% of the oldest group.  Cruise control was the third most used of the studied systems; 41% of the participants reported using it. The variation between countries was quite large, from 67% of the Australian drivers to 25% of the Czech drivers. Male respondents had a cruise control more often than female ones (p<0.01). Use of cruise control also correlated clearly (p<0.001) with annual mileage: 27% of the drivers with annual mileage less than 5 000 km had cruise control. The respective share of drivers driving more than 30 000 km annually was 59%. The youngest group (<26 years old) had and used cruise control less (32%) than the other drivers (over 40%).  A speed limiter or a speed alert was not yet very commonly used. Only 18% of the drivers reported using a speed limiter and 32% a speed alert system. Speed limiter use varied a lot between the participating countries, from 36% in Spain to as low as 5% in Finl and. Male drivers had and used both a speed limiter and speed alert more often than female drivers (p<0.01). Drivers with a high annu al mileage also had a speed lim iter or a speed alert more often than drivers with a low ann ual mileage (p<0.01). The differences between the a ge groups were not statistically significant.  A more detailed a nalysis, including the frequency and ways of using the systems and user  assessment of the systems, was carried out on the respondents having the system.  Frequency of use of IVT systems The majority of users of cruise control (N=2957), a speed limiter (N=1361), and a speed alert (N=2494) considered themselves to be regular users of the systems, in other words using the systems at least once a week. Based on this self-reporting it was estimated that drivers having a cruise control use it 46% of the time, a speed limiter 42% of the time and a speed for 40% of the time. 6  A navigation system (N=6842) and a mobile phone (N=3988) are used mostly occasionally, less than o nce a week. How ever, so me differences were found between the p articipating countries, indicating that in coun tries with the highest rate of mobile phone use g enerally (Finland and Portugal),  t he frequ ency of use w hile driv ing i s also  h ighest; 31 % of the  Portuguese drivers repo rted frequ ent use ( at least on ce a day) of a mobile pho ne w hile driving. The share of frequent users in the whole data (N=3988) was 18%.  WAYS OF USING THE IVT SYSTEMS More than half of the users indicated that they set th e cruise control speed equal to the current speed limit; 23% reported selecting a sp eed that is above the current speed limit and 13% reported selecting a speed be low the current speed limit. There were so me differences between countries, indicating that Finnish drivers set the speed above the speed limit more often that the others (Figure 1).

Selection of speed for cruise control by country (%).  Most of the drivers who reported setting the speed above the legal limit said that they did so by < 5 k m/h. H owever, di fferences foun d betw een th e countries ( Figure 2 ) indica te that especially Portuguese, Spanish and British drivers who choose to set the speed above the legal limit do so considerably in excess of it.  7 Selection of speed for Cruise Control: difference between the selected speed (if above speed limit) and legal speed limit0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 %Australia  Austria    Czech RepublicFinland    France   Holland    Portugal   Spain      UK         < 5 km/h6-10 km/h11-15 km/h16-20 km/h> 20 km/h Figure 2. Selection of speed for cruise control: difference between the selected speed and speed limit (%). Note: includes only drivers who indicated selecting a speed above the legal limit.  Speed alert was more commonly used than a speed limiter. When selecting the speed for the systems, more than half of the driv ers selected a speed equal to the legal speed limit. In addition, so me drivers already  had speed alert sy stems th at d etect and  set the sp eed automatically acc ording to th e current speed limit, w hen av ailable in the d igital maps database. When comparing country-specific data on speed selection, similar tendencies were observed to the use of cruise control.  There wer e s ome differences between c ountries when comparing th e t ype of navigation system. The portable dedicated navigation system was the most common navigation system in every country. However, the share of in-buil d navig ators and using a  mobile pho ne as a navigator varied between countries. For example, 20% of Finnish and Portuguese drivers but only 5% of Dutch drivers used their mobile phone as a navigator. Most of the drivers favored entering the destination in the navigation system when the car was not moving: 73% when the engine was off and 51% when the car was started but not moving yet. Drivers were also asked to indicate if there are situations in which they avoid entering the destination information into the navigator; 73% reported avoiding data input during the trip and 67% at the start of the trip when the car is already moving. Based on these figures, it can be said that one third of the drivers enter data into the navigator while driving.  8  The usage of a mobile phone varied quite a lot between countries. Finnish and Po rtuguese drivers were the most frequent mobile phone users while driving. Finns typically used voice calls, but Portuguese drivers al so reported quite high rates in re ading (27%) and sending (17%) SMS. Fifty-four percent of the drivers reported that they use a hands free system for all or almost all of their phone calls; 13% reported that they use the hands free for less than half of their phone calls, and 14% for none or almost none of their calls. The usage of hands free was lowest in Finland and highest in Portugal.   USER ASSESSMENT OF STUDIED IVT SYSTEMS Cruise control was considered to be mostly a comfort system, which also helps to control the speed and reduces speeding. As expected, it was seen to be most useful on motorways, when the weather is good, when the traffic density is low and also when there are speed checks by police. Crui se control was consid ered leas t useful in tra ffic jams, city streets, a nd when stopping is expected in general (road wor ks, special warnings, heavy traffic). Most of th e users (80%) consid ered cruise control to be useful and easy  to use. However, quite a l ot of users also indicated something negative: almost 30% were concerned about driver distraction or taking o ver control of the car fro m the driver. In addition, almost 20% indicated so me problems understanding how the system works or they found it unreliable.  Speed limiter and speed alert were considered to be most useful in co ntrolling speed and hence reducing speeding. Quite a lot of drivers also indicated that the systems improve traffic safety. The systems were considered to be most useful when there are speed checks, on long trips, motorways, in good weather conditions and when the traffic density is low. In addition, speed alert was also considered to be us eful during night-time driving. In al l, speed li miter (average usefulness 3.1 ¨C on a scale of 0¨C5) or speed alert (3.5) were rated more useful than cruise control (2. 7). Conce rns of distract ion and unreliabilit y w ere of r oughly the sam e magnitude as for cruise control.  Navigation system was considered to b e most useful when the driver is in an unfamiliar environment or lost. The drivers also reported that the navigator calculates good ro utes and removes the stress of finding the destination. Even if most of the drivers found navigation to be useful (average 3.3 on a scale of 0¨C5), quite a marked group of 25% were concerned about the reliability of the navigation system and experienced difficulty understanding the system¡¯s functionality.  User assessment of a mobile phone focused on situations when drivers avoid or favor using a mobile phone while driving. Over 70% of the respondents indicated that they avoid using a mobile phone when in  a complex situation, su ch as merging, turning or in a n unfamiliar 9 environment. Other situations during which most drivers avoided mobile phone use included heavy traffic, cities, ro ad works a nd po or weather. Fifty-four percen t of the d rivers al so indicated that they avoid using a mobile phone when using a navigation system. On the other hand, quite a lot of drivers (40%) favored using a mobile phone when driving in a familiar environment or on highways.  INSIGHTS ON TRAFFIC SAFETY Drivers were also asked to ass ess o n a 5-poi nt scale (no t dang erous at all to extremely dangerous) how dangerous they consider different activities to be while driving. More than 60% of the drivers consider ed any writing (with a pen or text messaging) to be extremely dangerous. In addition, 43% found ¡®dialing a mobile phone¡¯ and 38% ¡®talking on a handheld mobile pho ne¡¯ to b e extremely dangerous. Ma nipulating the por table music play er of a  navigation s ystem w as found to b e extr emely dangerous by  alm ost 2 0% of the drive rs, whereas manipulating a radio/CD  or cruise control was thus considered by only 7%. Six percent of the drivers assessed talking on a hands-free  mobile phone  to be extre mely dangerous. There w ere clear cross- cultural di fferences in opinions concerning the dangerousness of using a mobile phone while driving. Whereas 58% of the Australian drivers indicated that it is extremely dangerous to make a phone call while driving, only 11% of the Finnish drivers reported accordingly. Similar differences were found between opinions of the dangerousness of talking on a handheld phone (Table 2). Talking on a hands-free phone was considered less dangerous in all the participating countries. 10 Table 2.

Also of interest were cross-cultural differences in the use and perceived benefits of the IVT systems.   The data was collected by Internet surveys in nine countries, and the sample was drawn from existing n ational p anels. Intern et survey is a cos t-effective method when gathering information from a lar ge group of people. However, one of the major disadvantages of the selected method was th e variation in structure of the pan els in each p articipating country. Hence, when comparing the results from each country, the differences in the national samples (age, gender, driving experience) need to be taken into account. In addition, it should be borne in mind that the final set of respondents only  included drivers identified as users of at least one of the systems included in the study.  The navigation sys tem w as the mos t co mmonly us ed of all the s tudied IVT systems. Regardless of annual mileage, navigation appears to be fairly widely used. Ol der drivers reported using a na vigation system slightly less than younger ones. Still, the usage rate was high even in the oldest age group. Most of the users found navigation to be useful. However, quite a few drivers stated that n avigation sy stems ar e un reliable o r found it dif ficult to understand how the systems work. One third of the driv ers did not report avoiding inputting data into a navigation system while driving.   The findings of this study ¡ª w idespread use of the system regardless of age or driving experience, and users deciding to interact with the systems while driving (also found by P?ysti et al. (8)) ¡ª highlight the importance of careful user-centered design and testing of the 11 navigation systems in r eal driving conditions. The small touch displays and ever-growing number of applications available for use on small portable devices are not making the task any easier.  More than half of the respondents reported using a mobile phone while driving. Differences in usage between countries were considerable, but in line with the findings of several earlier studies (8) (9) (1 0). The differences between countries can at le ast in part be attributed to differences in legislation and enforcement. It should be noted that use of hand-held mobile phones while driving is banned in all of the participating countries (11). However, there are differences in enforce ment. Hol land seem s to  have  the strictes t p olicy, with fine s up to  2 000¡þ, whereas many other countries ha ve f ines of less th an 100¡þ.  Portugal also has restrictions on the use of hands-fre e mobile phones while driving, but enforcement seems to be quite rare, at least based on the reported usage rates of a mobile phone for both voice calls and text messaging in Portugal.   The difference in mobile phone use between driver groups (age, annual mileage) seems to be greater than in the use of a navigation system. Drivers with low mileage and the oldest drivers seem to use a mobile phone less than the others. It has been stated (8) (14) that age is a decisive factor when considering phone-related risks i n traffic. Bo th elder ly d rivers and novice drivers are at increased risk w hen using a ph one while driv ing. In addition, it is expected that usage of a mobile phone while driving will continue to increase in the new aging cohorts. This may be a matter of concern in the future.  The usage of cruise control varied between the countries, being highest in Australia and lowest in the Czech Repub lic. Since cruis e control is ty pically part  of a car¡¯s origi nal equipment, the differences in car fleet (age, make) (11) correlate with the penetration of cruise control in addition to the driver¡¯s age and annual mileage. The use of adaptive cruise control (ACC) was still quite rare. It was also estimated that cruise control is used 46% of t he time (among drivers having the system). In some of the earlier studies (2) (4) estimating the safety potential of in-vehicle-systems, the assumed usage rate for adaptive cruise control was 80%. Based on this study the figure see ms somewhat overoptimistic, even if most of the cruise control systems in this study were of the non-adaptive type.  Drivers typically reported s etting the cruise control speed equal to the speed limit. If not  equal, the speed was set more frequently above than below the limit. The results support the earlier impact assessments of intelligent in-vehicle-systems (2) (4) that  the use of a cruis e control may slightly increase the mean speed. However, reported b ehavior in th e different speed lim it zones, traf fic environ ment or driving cond itions, i ncluding weat her and the average speed of the traffic flow, traffic density etc., was not investigated in this study. In 12 addition, the observed differences between the countries may be partly explained by different way of reporting ¡®speeding¡¯ or ¡®setting the speed over the speed limit¡¯; hence the findings in this study were not in line with the earlier studies, such as SARTRE (13). These aspects can be further studied in the upcoming w ork pack ages of the INTERA CTION proj ect, with  experimental and naturalistic driving tests.   Differences in the use of a speed alert in the participating countries were not significant. By contrast, th e use of a speed limit er varied s ignificantly betw een co untries. This was  as  expected since speed alert can be  a feature on a portable device (navigator, mobile phone) whereas a speed limiter is mainly part of th e car¡¯s original equipment. Speed-controlling systems (alert and limiter) were assessed to be used about 40% of the time. This can be taken into account when estimating the potential safety effects of the systems. In earlier studies (2) (4) it was assu med that the speed control system is in use 55% of the time. Based on this study, the figure may be slightly overoptimistic.  Most users of the spe ed limiter and speed alert reported setting the system according to the speed limit, or even below it. A minority of drivers reported setting the speed above the legal limit. It seems that the assumption made in earlier impact assessments (2) (4) that the speed is set according to the speed l imit is justified. The benefits of a speed  limiter or speed alert as reported by the participants of the survey are in line with the goals of the systems: ¡®to control speed¡¯ or ¡®to reduce speeding¡¯.  CONCLUSIONS The development and penetration of IVT systems over the past two decades has been rapid. If IVT systems are designed ergonomically and used appropriately, they have the potential to significantly enhance safety, mobility and driving comfort. However, little is yet known about how much drivers actually use the systems, and in which context they interact with them. In addition, the long-term effects of the use on driver behavior, performance, and hence traffic safety are largely unknown. The main objective of the INTERACTION project was to identify patterns of use of IVT by European drivers during their normal driving. Also studied were individual as well as cross-cultural differences.  Based on t he ques tionnaire s tudy, u sers perc eive IV T t o be useful for t hem. E specially navigation, cruise control and speed alert were given positive ratings in usefulness. There were some cross-cultural differences in th e use of the systems. Some preliminary findings indicate that certain users may have problems understanding the functions of so me of th e systems. Use of the systems, especially navigation, is fairly widespread among all the driver groups, regardless of driving experience or ag e. Also, drivers do interact with the systems 13 while driv ing. This highlights the i mportance o f u ser-centered design of IVT  sy stems, including their testing in real traffic. Detailed contexts and manner of use of the s tudied IVT will be examined in greater depth in upcoming parts of the INTERACTION project.

  - 1 -TRUST-NETWORKS FOR CHANGING DRIVER BEHAVIOR DURING SEVERE WEATHER   Katarina Elevant Royal Institute of Technology KTH Lindstedtsv?gen 3, 100 44 Stockholm, Sweden +46702828577, katael@kth.se    ABSTRACT  The vulnerability of m odern cities to severe weather, decrease d traffic safety and  efficiency, challenge conventional weather se rvice providers while raising new dem ands on robustness of the society and weather inform ation services. In this p aper, som e results f rom studies of  a  network for sharing weather information, are presented. The network, based on one m eteorology expert and 440 volunteers interested in weat her due to their daily dependence on traffic conditions, was used as a chan nel for providing early w arnings on severe w eather events predicted to occur in S tockholm. In several experiments performed in 2010, the participants ¡¯ behavior and evaluation of th e service were m easured thr ough answ ers provided in several questionnaires on habits and behavior, additi onally including users¡¯ own wea ther reports provided on request of the expert. Based upon the acquired results, this paper suggests that social networks are a convenient channel and the best  available m ethod for e fficient distribution and dissemination of weather alerts to the broad public.  Keywords: weather, information service, early warning, severe weather, participation, changed behavior, drivers, scoring, share weather, web 2.0    INTRODUCTION  Severe weather occasionally im pacts society in terms of significant costs,  representing a burden to the community. Addition ally, the negative effects of adverse weather are predicted to further increase as modern societies becom e more complex (1), and due to  an increased number of severe even ts caused by climate change (2)(3 ). In the short term, daily  impacts of weather, however, might be nota ble even un der less s evere weather conditions than events subjec ted to official warnings. W eather causes traffic flow  decline (4 ) and increased risks for hazards (5)(6)(7). This paper addresses traffic safety a nd efficiency in the tra nsportation system. The results presented here have em erged from  expe riments perform ed within a research project conducted at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, ai ming at identifying ne w ways of providing weather alerts to the pu blic (8)(9), including st udies on user participation and ¡°user-generated¡± weather observations (10)(11).     - 2 -PERSONALIZATION OF WEATHER INFORMATION  Previous findings within the project suggest us er p articipation and  user-g enerated wea ther observations as an instrum ent that m ight encourage increased public involvem ent in different weather-related issu es (11), such as increased trustworth iness toward providers of weather warnings to the pub lic (8). The importanc e of relating to personal life, and in particular trust, when providing information on road weather, is  here assum ed to impact drivers¡¯ on-road behavior and decision-making. As the ¡°good ICT soci ety¡± (12) includes co llective and personal involvement in the process of social change and progress that arise from new communication technologies, the public should be increasingly engaged in ITS. Active participation by users of a road weather serv ice, including feed-back and providing real-time observations on the current state, states an example of personal engagement in ITS services.  In order to m easure the actual societal im pacts of such engagement, however, it is im portant to develop methods that m easure actual changed beha vior. In this paper, a m ethod for m easuring changed behavior, based on a combination of scoring (11), and changed decision-m aking and actions, was applied.   The basic claim is that human networks across cyberspace and social media can act as a carrier of traffic weather alerts. This hypothesis is based on empirical evidence manifesting the importance of social media as a carrier of im portant information in cases of e mergencies like earthquakes, floods, and political events. It has been suggested  that user-generated weather observations m ay have implications within weather forecasting with applications such as traffic weather predictions and alerts (8)(10)(11). Analogous examples on spatial data like NASA¡¯ clickworkers (13) and geological information for gold-m ining (14), de monstrating ¡°the power of crowdsourcing and sometimes surprising levels of accum ulated knowledge on the lo cal habitat and environm ent, driven by individuals¡¯ personal interests ¡° (11).   Currently, sensor technologies  and traffic sensor technology, with an increased num ber of variables and with in creased spatial resolution (15), makes an im portant contribution to better traffic weather forecasting, traffic planning an d safer tran sportation system s. However, the potential power of crowdsourcing of weather data performed by human observers connected to a (social) network is illu strated by the f act that som e variables tha t are dif ficult to f orecast (e.g. cloud cover, precipitation extrem es), can surprisingly easily be  measured by non-experts, and peer-viewed (e.g. cloud pictures ) (10)(11)(16). Som e basic ch allenges of m odern meteorology WMO (2), include improving weather forecasting methods, a problem related to increased spatial sampling of data (10)(17)(18), wh ich can be addressed with im proved local data collected from  users of ITS services.   It can thus be suggested that new transpor tation m anagement system s and ITS can utilize citizens¡¯ weather observations and other observations of the urban environment, while improving their own services toward the citizen s and providing personalized information to the citizens. In order to achieve the goal of developing such a network, building trust and commitment is needed. Due to some earlier results, it  can be suggested that such motivations do exist am ong weather-dependent individuals such as long-distance travellers (11), a group studied in this paper.    - 3 -OBJECTIVES  While developing a ¡°share weathe r¡± platform (www.shareweather.com) for collection of local  weather and climate data, a s ervice consisting of weather alerts is s een as a driv er to make individual contributions, and, in add ition, impact users¡¯ behavior during severe weather.  It has  previously been suggested (10)(11) how i ndividuals m ay be regarded as mobile, non-standardized, weather observation stations, used in  order to improve local weather forecasts due to a procedure sim ilar to that applied for ¡°now casting¡±, and suggests that  the ¡°share weather¡± system m ay apply a com bination of the m ethods previously developed for nowcasting and integration of e.g. vol unteer observations from  ships (19), while addition ally introdu cing collaborative f iltering in the f irst stage of  data collectio n. As a reward, users  will rece ive personalized services, based on user-generated information: current weather, behavior and previous observations (8)(10).  In this paper, we analyze changed behavior manifested among respondents joining a network and exposed to a weather alert servi ce, with the aim of estim ating the value and feasibility of trust-networks as  a delivery  channel of weather aler ts, while user-generated observations are not treated here. Because participati on itself m ay affect users¡¯ a nswers when reques ted to provid e their judgment on the service, th e paper, in addition, introduces the method of comparing users¡¯ ¡°scoring¡± of the service (11), to users¡¯ actual behavior issued by th e service, in order to separate the impacts of participation in the network, from actual impacts of the weather alert service.  The general goal is to create person alized services addressing the individual in daily life, where  transportation is studied in particular, in order to improve life quality and generate values to the society, e.g. changed behavior that m ight in crease safety  on roads and efficien cy of the transportation system . In order to investigate individual behavior and perception of weather warnings, a series of experim ents were performed during winter seasons 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and fall/win ter 2010, f ollowed by  questionn aires. In th is paper, we address th e followi ng questions: ¡þ To what extent did the respondents change their behavior due to the received warnings? ¡þ What are th e key facto rs contributing to ch anged behavior and trust toward the service  provider in this particular network? ¡þ How does trust and comm itment evolve over tim e, depending on the ti me of exposure to the weather warning service? ¡þ How can these results be generalized, as we  draw som e conclusions on the potential of personalized services based on social netw orks and social m edia technologies, to encourage changed behavior before and during severe weather events?   METHOD  The study presented in this paper is a part of a research project developing personalized early-warning weather alert service, and studying ¡°share weather¡± communities and integration of user-generated content into the tradition al content of weather services. W ithin the res earch project, several studies were arra nged during the period 2008-2010, a ll of which were based on questionnaires provided to recipients of a weat her warning service. The early wea ther warning   - 4 -service consisted of SMSs and e- mails sent to the respondents about 1 day, in som e cases 2 to 3 days, prior to the occurrence of severe weather events. The weather warning service was based on a ¡°recent¡± weather m odel (8), bas ed on the assum ption that a weath er alert is relevan t if the difference between recent weather and the predicted weather exceeds a threshold value. Previous experiments led to about 11 weather alerts during winter season 2008/2009 and 33 alerts in 2009/2010. By the com mencement of the third s eason, by end of November 2010, 14 warnings had already  been sent.  Occasionally, dur ing winter seasons 2008/2 009 and 2009/2010, th e respondents were addressed with questionnaires  on: habits regardi ng weather inform ation acquisition, transportation habits, preferences regarding the service (e.g. design and frequency of alerts), users¡¯ opinions regarding the quality of the service, and changed behavior. Additionally, during a short period in early 2010,  the respondents were  asked to provide volunteer reports on observed local weather and road conditions.  This paper, presenting results on changed behavior  caused by exposure to the service, is m ainly based on two surveys conducted in 2010, addressi ng 440 existing respondents that had been recruited at the time.  RESPONDENTS  The process of recruiting respondents was initi ated early fall 2008, th rough trafiken.nu, a portal administrated by the Swedish Road Adm inistration, the City of Stockholm  and Public Transport SL, providing general traffic information for the Stockholm county. The respondents were invited to participate in tes ting a new weather aler t serv ice, leave c omments, participa te in  questionnaires, and, in som e cases, interviews. The second channel of recruitm ent was Radio Stockholm P4, a part of  the public service SR network, covering the county of Stockholm, both broadcasting the weather alerts and providing an i nvitation to join th e project. Also here, th e research project was promoted as a service unde r development and invita tion to participate in improving the service. Radio Stockholm  comm enced the prom otion of the project first i n December 2009. However, the alerts reached great public exposure through radio Stockholm, as, beside being offered as SMS, add itionally broadcasted o n the radio,  reaching half a m illion listeners, while the web presentati on of trafiken.nu consisted of an invitation linked to the latest alert. Starting with about 40 participants, the num ber of re spondents increased over tim e, eventually reaching 500 in 2010.  These initial conditions create two important differences between respondents due to: 1. tim e of exposure to the service and participation in the network, and 2. different channels of recruitment.  It is justifiable to a ssume that respondents recruited thr ough Radio Stockholm were exposed to multiple exposure of the service as still utilizing the channel of recruitment (radio listening). The majority of early respondents (2008/2009) were recruited through trafiken.nu, while respondents recruited from Radio Stockholm were overrepresented in some particular respondent groups that joined in connection to interviews in a ra dio program (December 2009 and Nove mber 2010). Dividing respondents into groups, they were categorized from early users that had joined in 2008 (Group I), to recently recruited users with at least one m onth of exposure (Group V). Group III, and in particular group V, consisted mainly of respondents recruited from Radio Stockholm.      - 5 -The Sample  The respondents were assum ed to c onsist of a dults with stronger weather dependence than an average person and possessing weather observing skills better than the average (8)(11). Interest in weather was found to be  of different origins (8):  a) strong weather dependence in daily life, for  example found a mong long-distance travelers, b) interest in new technology, and c) genuine interest (encouraged by e.g. a hobby). Those who needed weathe r information the m ost, e.g. long-distance travelers,  in addition  provided th e m ost accurate observations. It can thus be assumed that the time of exposure to the ¡°share weather network¡± improved the ability to observe weather. In other terms: groups whose lives and property are weat her-dependent tend to develop weather observation skills, also confirm ed by th rough history and literature (20). At the sam e time, it raises questions on the characteristics of sample, as it can be assum ed that respondents joined the study because they are motivated to purchase weather information.  WEATHER CASES  In this particular study, we m ainly focus on two questionnaires. The questionnaires contained questions regarding changed behavior directly  caused by the early weather warnings, and the  weather during the latest m onth: December 2009 and January 2010 (S1), and November (S2) . Survey S1 is represented by a questionnaire  sent out in January 2010, while S2 was a questionnaire sent in December 2010, both referring to the weather during the past 30-40 days.  Recent Weather Hypothesis and Generalizability of Weather Cases  It can be noted that the wint er season 2009/10, and the beginni ng of winter season 2010/2011 in Sweden were both cold  and rich in  precipitation coming as snow, compared to winter season 2008/2009. For exam ple, only 11 weather alerts were sent 2008/2009, com pared to 33 in 2009/2010. The large num ber of severe events ( 14) during October and Nove mber 2010 (early season 2010/2011), would therefore at first sugge st that com parison is  justifiable between January 2010 and November 2010. As we, however, re gard different phases of the winter season - November compared to January - the results might be considerably impacted.  Numerous studies on on-road behavi or highlight the im portance of unusualness with icy  o r snowy road conditions that surprise drivers. For example, evidence supporting that ¡°if it rained a lot yesterday, then on average, today there are fe wer crashes¡± (21), witne ss on drivers¡¯ inability to revise initial hypothesis (22)(23), and, in addition, suggests time-scales corresponding to days, rather than months. These finding were applied when defining the recent weather hypothesis (8), which can be expressed as: a weath er event will occur only if  the difference between now, and what has been observed during recent days, has impact on activities in daily life.  Higher frequency of serious accidents occurrin g early season (e.g. Novem ber) and late season compared to m id-season (January), has also b een recognized in different studies (24). Mid-season, dominated by generally colder tem peratures, statistically decreasing the num ber of cases with rain, will, in terestingly, increase the risk of oc currence of com plicated and, from maintenance perspective, very difficult pheno mena like black ice, usually caused by rain followed by sudden tem perature drops. Finally, equipm ent, e.g. wint er tires, used, varies from early-season to mid-season. For example, in Sweden, winter tires are m andatory from December   - 6 -1st. These fi ndings lead to the conclusion that dr ivers will perceive road weather differently during early and mid-season, suggesting that drivers might possibly perceive a weather warning differently. The personalization method base d on ¡°recent weather¡±, however, by contrast, suggests that the weather observed during the previous months is of diminishing importance, and that, consequently, extreme average weather sho uld have minor effect on drivers¡¯ perception of single events (8)(11). It is, therefore, justifiable to assume that an extrem ely cold winter with large amounts of precipitation coming as snow, such as winter season 2009/2010 and early season 2010/2011, is not probable to impact the results of the study.  Variability of observed weather as perceived by a human observer is, though, affected by: micro-climate, human influence (e.g. m aintenance), and individual perception of the observer (20). In general, cases with extreme weather tend to be uniform over a relatively small area by the size of Stockholm county, as the weather strikes abruptl y, representing a large change com pared to initial conditions, achie ved over a large area. In early season cases from 2009, the im pact of micro-climate during early season was, however, clearly manifested (11). Because the particular weather cases of this study we re early-season (November 2010) and mid-season (January 2010), the results must be analyzed in regard to: 1. perception (e.g. surprise effects), 2. local variability of weather conditions, and 3. perception due to different equipment.   THE SERVICE  The service was delivered as a perso nal SMS or/and e-mail which contained a plain text with a  weather forecast. The forecast was a text of size one or two SMS messages, shortly describing the expected change, nature of w eather phenomena, consequences regarding road conditions, and course of future weather development. One alert was often followed by a second warning or update on current conditions. The alerts were usually delivered 24 hours prior to the occurrence of the events. Additionally, most events were predicted in updates of current warnings.  The background material used to create the foreca sts was strictly based on free data available on the Internet. This leads  to the  conclusion that the actual qu ality of the servic e content was no t higher than other available inform ation, e.g. official weather forecasts provided by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, or traditional weather forecasts on TV.   MEASURING TRUST AND COMMITMENT  The research design had to tackle  the lack of arrang ements to observe the actual behavior of respondents, as the stud y did not have access to  any other sources of evidence of respondents¡¯ behavior. Because the results are m erged from answers supplied by  respondents them selves, separation of trust/commitment and actual perception, even possible violations in terms of unjust answers, was questionable.  Commitment, Trust and Motivation to Participate  In order to study changed behavior , we first regard respondents¡¯ in itial trust toward the service provider and comm itment to the network. Prev ious analysis on winter seasons 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 provided some important results on motivation, characterized by high participation in questionnaires (about 60-70%) (8)(11), significant contributions in term s of use r-generated observations, and high confidence in the service and the expert (8)(11). Although motives related   - 7 -to participation in the n etwork and social valu es (e.g. social accep tance, recognition) cannot be separated from the values generated by the servic e, these high p articipation figures strongly suggest that the respon dents som ehow benefitted from the serv ice. It is im portant to note,  however, that motivation to m ake contributions in term s of tim e investment in vol unteer work consisting of weather observations and particip ation in questionnaires,  does not necessarily correlate with actual changed behavior.   Scoring and Changed Behavior  The new methodology introduced in this paper consis ts of two steps. First, the respondents were asked to ¡°score¡± th e weather forecast prov ided by the expert. The scori ng was then studied in relation to the answers they pr ovided regarding thei r behavior. Network theory w ould suggest additional social motives embedded in the answer s, such as social acceptance, recognition, and commitment to the project and the expert that provided the service, manifested as a tendency to  provide answers that are in favor to the servi ce and more optimistic judgments and evaluation of the same. In previous studies (11), it was found that that the respondents m anifested personal engagement expressed in variety of comments and explanations on both weather phenomena and their experiences. However, duri ng early season, slightly p oor scoring was found, which was logical due to increased local  variability during early season com pared to m id-season. Low scoring in early-season, however, also pointed at honesty in respondents¡¯ answers and absence of placebo. Most im portant, earlier studies (8)(11) also indicated stronger comm itment a mong respondents that had participated longer.  The challenge of separating trust from actual perception was thus met by comparing how scoring and changed behavior varied over respondent groups (I-V) with different time of exposure to the service and participation in the network. The methodological approach was to compare group I to V¡¯s ¡°scoring¡± of the service in January 2010 and November 2010, where group I had participated since 2008, and group V the group most recently recruited. We, thus, base the results presented in this paper on two i mportant methodological steps: 1) careful separation of different respondents due to the time they had participated, and 2) comparison between scoring and changed behavior.  Groups due to Time of Exposure  The respondents were divided into groups I-III that  had joined at the tim e of the January survey, and additional two groups IV and V that had joined thereafter, but before Novem ber 2010. In Table 1, groups and their participation in the network (P) and surveys (S) is illustrated, where   Table 1. Participation and groups.                                2008                     2009                     2010               January survey    December survey Group I P P P S1 67% P P S2 68% Group II  P P S1 59% P P S2 51% Group III   P S1 77% P P S2 57% Group IV    P P S2 55% Group V     P S2 67% January survey is denoted S1 and S2 is equivalent to the December survey.    - 8 -Scoring  ¡°Scoring¡± was perform ed as the respondents were asked to com pare the received forecast to actual weather they observed, pr ovided f ive options: ¡°be tter/worse than predicted¡±, ¡°slightly  better/worse¡±, and ¡°as predicted¡±. If strictly regarding ¡°scoring¡± as a m ethod, it is designed to reflect the quality of individual observations (11), by regarding al l cases where the s core of the expert Se is equal to the respondent¡¯s score S r. The score of the expert S e on the other hand, is assumed to be equal to the forecast F whenever the forecast is correct. Incorrect forecasts m ay provide Se non-equal to F. Existing cases with b ad forecasts, and local differences due to micro-climate, will reduce the number of scores where Se = Sr. The number of Se = Sr will consequently always be less or equal to the real num ber of correct observations provided by respondents, reflecting the lowest level of quality of observations provided by users.  Scoring might, however, be affected by personal opinions and values, which is subjected here. If scoring does reflect personal engagem ent and commitment, higher scoring should be m anifested among old members of the network, as is a decline of scoring with increasing group index I-V.   Comparison with Other Forecasts  The process of scoring was additionally applied on other sources of weather information, in order to recognize the respondents attitude and confidence in the weather warning service compared to other weather service providers. In theory, the weather warning service should not manifest better scores, because the weather service provided by the expert was based on lim ited m aterial accessible through the Internet, whil e most other sources of weather inform ation have advanced tools and extensive data as input to their forecasts.  CHANGED BEHAVIOR: MEASUREMENT METHODS  Changed Decisions  One of the m ajor questions addres sed to th e respondents was a m ultiple-choice question o n changed decisions regarding changed decisions due to the warnings they had received. The listed options are  represen ted in Fig 2. In additio n to altern atives cons idering tr ansportation and activities, the respondents were also given the options to adm it absence of existing planned activities, or to declare that did not change any decisions, and provide additional comments.   Frequency of Changed Decisions  The frequency of changed trans portation plans and activities was additionally measured with a complementary question on the num ber of occasions that had resulted in changed decisions and plans, provided: 1 of 3 occasions  after a warn ing was received, 2 of 3 occasions,  all occasions. The questions specifically referred to recent warnings or the last month.       - 9 -Change of Equipment  The respondents were requested to estimate the impact of the weat her service on their decisions, compared to other external factors, in order to eliminate possible sources of errors in the answers, due to other factors that m ight affect change  of equipm ent, e.g. arranging appointm ents at a professional manufacturer. Change of tires was assumed to ref lect the trustworthiness in th e service, rep resenting u sers¡¯ long -term planning. Because the service contain ed essential information on weather predictions ten days ahea d, and a cold October was interrupted by a two week long period characterized by fair road weather conditions, such premises did exist.    RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  TRUST AND COMMITMENT  Participation of Different Groups  Division of 440 respondents into groups in regard  to the point in tim e they had joined the  network provided group sizes ranging from  57 members (Group I) to 105 (Group IV), justifying quantitative analyses.  As presented in Table 1, partic ipation in surve ys varied between 51% and 77%. The general remark is that participation of Groups II and III in the December survey (S2) declined compared to participation rates registered in January (S1). These results are consistent with earlier findings on participation rates registered since the commencement of the pr oject, indicating lower participation in early and late seasons com pared to m id-season. One explanation is drivers¡¯  expectations on weather, due to ¡°surprise¡± eff ects and the ¡°recent weath er¡± hypothesis. In early  season, drivers have not yet e xperienced severe weather, wh ich lowered the m otivation to respond to questionnaires.  Also notable is the tendency of new users to participate in their first survey, for example group III 77% participation rate in January 2010 com pared to only 57% in November 2010. These results do, not, however, suggest a general decline of participation rates with time. By contrast, sustained participation was demonstrated, for example illustrated by Group I with stable participation rate (from 67% to 68%). Interestingly, Group I, which m anifested sustained participation, had a high fraction of respondents over 50, suggesting a stronger com mitment, or dispensable tim e, with increasing age.   Scoring  It can be assum ed that the res pondents were affected by thei r relationship with the expert. Responses might be colored by po sitive attitude, social drives like s ocial acceptance within a network, and placebo.     - 10 -  Fig 1. Scoring of the service and other sources of weather information. Green represents the fraction of sc ores ¡°as forecasted¡± from December survey (S2), while the blue  represents the equivalent for January survey (S1). The brighter colors represent scores of other sources of weather information.  The results, some of which are rep resented in Figure 1, point at differences regarding tim e of season, with 15% strong er support for scoring ¡°as forecasted¡± in mid-season (S1) compared to early seaso n (S2). Possible facto rs were previ ously identified as (issues 1-3): microclim ate, perception due to recent weather experiences, or inadequate equipment.  More interestingly, in S2, we may recognize decreased s cores with increased exposure to th e service: among respondents that had participat ed longer th an a year (Group I-III), about 45% scored ¡°as forecasted¡±, while that figure was significantly higher (over 60%) for groups IV and V that had joined m ore recently. New users, addition ally, provided low amounts of scores ¡°as forecasted by other sou rces of weather informa tion¡± (e.g. TV and other available sources of weather information).  These results im ply that new users were either : a) under stronger infl uence of social drive connected to participation in the research project (the network), or b) experiencing the service as notably higher-quality compared to other forecasts. Resu lts on survey participation presented in Table 1 additionally support these conclusions.  CHANGED BEHAVIOR  Changed Decisions and Planning of Transportation and Activities  Results on changed decision-making regarding transportation and activities are illustrated in Fig 2. Due to the results, the respondents¡¯ decisions were extensively affected by the service and its content, which was m anifested in changed decisi ons on: travel route, change of equipm ent, cancelled activities and trips, in cluding distance-work. Answers on changed decisions occupied 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Group I Group II Group III Group IV Group V November (other sources) November (alert service) January (other sources) January (alert service)   - 11 -about 70 to 90% of total. However, taking into account that answers were multiple, the number of respondents that reported one or several change d decisions ranged between 51 and 73 %, aft er excluding comments and those who did not have any planned trips.  On average, the fraction of res pondents that had replied ¡°no cha nged decisions¡± (Fig 3) was 15-30%, except for group II in S1 with 43% ¡°no ch anged decisions¡±. A glance at the dem ographic properties revealed that Group II had the largest fraction of m en under 40 years. We cautiously conclude that this result m ight be in line wi th earlier findings on you ng male drivers¡¯ higher confidence in own driving skills, and violations in traffic, e.g. speeding (22).     Fig 2.  Changed decisions  after receiving a weather  warning. Answers provided by group I-V are pl otted in different colors. ¡°Total changed decisions¡± refers to fraction of respondents that had provided one or several changed decisions.  From Fig 2, it can be concluded that distance -work was somewhat surprisingly high, in general  between 2 and 5%, which, however, is not generalizab le to the population, because these high figures may be explained by the characteristics of  the sample. Long distance-travellers are m ost probably forced to become more flexible in their daily planning in general.  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% Changed plans/ac vi es Started a trip/ac vity earlier Started a trip/ac vity later Cancelled trip/ac vity Cancelled trip to work Changed to winter res Changed to advanced res Changed to summer res TOTAL changed decisions No changed decisions Absence of plans Don't know Don't remember Other/comments Group V Group IV Group III Group II Group I   - 12 - Fig 3. No changed decisions. The percent of respondents reporting ¡°no changed decisions¡± in January survey S1 (dark colors), and December 2010 survey S2 (light colors), plotted for groups I-III.  Surprisingly, group groups that had joined recent ly and/or were recruited from Radio Stockholm (III, IV and V) had higher frac tions of changed decisions. Th is result m ay further support previous conclusions regarding high scoring due to : a) social motives as joining the network, or b) positive experience of a new service. A third possibility is, however, increased trust due to the fact that majority of the res pondents were recruited through Radio Stockholm, that, in addition, broadcasted the alerts. Group III and V were expos ed to repeated m essages, which might have affected their perception  and raised  the trustw orthiness of the m essage. More interestingly, the fact that the message was heard by a half million radio listeners may be seen as an  extension of the weather warning network to a far larger number of participants, which may have affected the experienced credibility. The fact that ¡°richer get richer¡± (25) may be applied here, and it can be stipulated that experienced credibility and trust was influenced by the number of nodes receiving the weather warnings.  It follows from  Fig 3 t hat the number of re spondents who did not change any decisions w as significantly higher in January than in Decembe r. One p ossible explanation is that Janua ry included winter holidays which lowered the number of trips. The d ifference between answers provided by Group I that had part icipated the longest, however, indicate a very sm all change from January to Decem ber, strongly supporting the earlier conclusion on su stained participation and sustained trust, even increased trustworthiness. Increased trustworthiness with time is, on the other hand, clearly supp orted by a drastic chan ge of behavior of group II and III, where ¡°no changed decisions¡± declined to less than a half in November 2010 of the number of ¡°no changed decisions¡± in January.  Theoretically, findings on drivers behavior in early season when still ¡°caught by surprise¡± by bad weather, by contrast, suggests that the num ber of changed deci sions should be low er for early season. Additionally, participation in surveys (Table  1) sh ows a slight declin e from January to  December. The latter may, however, suggest that the users that did not respond to q uestionnaires are likely to respond ¡°no changed decisions¡±. S till, taking the fraction of decreased survey participation into account, and assum ing that  responses from  non-part icipants would have enlarged the amount of ¡°no changed decisions¡± in December, a significant gap between January¡¯s 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% S2 Group III S1 Group III  S2 Group II S1 Group II  S2 Group I S1 Group I   - 13 -and December¡¯s ¡°no changed decisions¡± would re main, strongly sug gesting eith er that: a) participation in the network had strong im pact, or b) very high confid ence in the service was expressed.   The findings of this study, thus, provide important results on how driver behavior was influenced during early season. W e must also keep in m ind possible factors that m ay have decreased the number of changed decisions in January: im pacts of win ter ho lidays, better equ ipment, and drivers¡¯ ability to adopt to new, more severe, weather conditions. Overall, although, we conclude that our results clearly indicate th at the service did impact drivers¡¯ behavior, that the effect was  sustained, even increasing with time.  Frequency of Changed Decisions  The period of tim e c onsidered being 30-40 days , im plies, for example, that 2-5% of the respondents did cancel a trip to work during the past month, but not how often that decision had been taken. Therefore, we further investigate the frequency of such decisions taken as a response to the early  weather warning se rvice. When asked in how m any cases of 3 they had changed decisions, the respondents provid ed ¡°in 1 of 3 cases¡± as the most common answer (21-41%), while ¡°all¡± received 6-21% of the responses. Group I had the highest nu mber of respondents that had changed their decision-m aking in all cases (21%), further supporting increased trust built within the expert-recipient network.  More important, and as illustrated in Fig 4, when calculating the actual number of occasions with changed decisions and summarizing those over the respondents, it is evident from the graphs  illustrating volumes of changed d ecisions perfor med by different groups, that u sers that had joined at an early ph ase m anifested greater change of behavior. T hese results additionally strengthen the conclusion that trust was built with increased tim e of exposure to the weather warnings and that the service did take effect on the respondents¡¯ behavior, with larger effects the longer an individual had been using the service.     Fig 4. Volumes of changed decisions per group. The estimated total number of occasions with changed behavior in January (S1) and November (December survey S2), as distributed over different groups.   All 2 0f 3 1 of 3 None Group I Group II Group III Group IV Group V   - 14 -Change of Equipment  Equivalent results were acquire d regarding changed de cisions, in this cas e chan ge of tires  (equipment), although the fact that external factors m ay interfere had to be taken  into accoun t. However, groups that had participated longer in the project, in part icular Group I, tended to base their planning of changing equipm ent, based on the early-weather warning service, to a significantly higher extent than groups that had joined recently. As can be seen by the slope of  the diagrams in Fig 5, it was clear that time of exposure to the service was a key variable, with an increasing number of decisions on equipment based on the service, due to increased exposure to the service. Fig 5 can be regarded  as a time-line, with groups that had joined recently given low x-values and then adding groups with larger tim e of exposure on the x-axis. The slope of the red curve implies increased usage of the service for taking decisions on change of equipm ent, with time passed since joining the network.  However, one exception was m anifested by group V, with str ong representation of respondents  recruited from Radio Stoc kholm. This m ay be addressed to the impacts of joining a larger, already established, network, or ¡°rich get richer¡± (25), resulting in high confidence in the service already in early phase of participation, due to the large number of participants (radio listeners).

The red line represents the fraction of respondents that considered the service ¡°most important¡± for their decision of change of equipment, for groups with different time of part icipation, starting with the group with shortest time of exposure (V) and ending with the group with longest time of exposure.    CONCLUSIONS   Aiming at improving early weather warning system s for ordinary citizens, this paper describes some results of a collaborative research project conducted at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm with partners within transportation bodies. In this paper, we present a study on 440 respondents performed in Stockholm 2010. The res pondents received an early weather warning 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Group V Group IV Group III Group II Group I Change of equipment due to the service Other factors Other / comments   - 15 -service from an expert (author of the pape r) starting between 2008 and 2010 depending on when they had jo ined th e project.  Tw o questionnaires were then arra nged after different tim e of exposure to  the serv ice: January 2 010, and Decem ber 2010. The respondents were m ainly addressed with questions on the perceived quality of the service and questions regarding changed decision and planning of their activities in daily life during the past 30-40 days.  Based on th e material presented in this p aper, we conclude that early weather warnings sent through SMS may be a powerful instrument for changing driver behavior before severe weather. We base this claim on some general results of the survey which manifested changes of decisions and behavior ranging from  changed tim e of rout e to cance lled trips, including distance-work. These different changes in daily life planning took effect on about  55-85% of the users that had responded to questionnaires, which m ay be cons idered high com pared to earlier findings on driver behavior, suggesting only a small fraction of changed decisions (3-16%) (26). The general questionnaire participation ra te w as considerably high ( 50-70%) further supporting that participation in the network did strengthen thei r trust toward the provider. The paper also introduces a new method of ¡°scoring¡±. First, the respondents are requested to ¡°score¡± the service. Then, the users are asked to report changed beha vior due to the weather serv ice. The results  suggest high trust in the servi ce provider, in partic ular when com pared to other sources of weather inform ation. Most im portant, proof was found that the service did im pact the respondents¡¯ behavior and decision-making, and these impacts increased with time of exposure.  Regarding the figures m anifested in this st udy, if applied on the population, adequate SMS weather alert services could poten tially impact transportation patterns of some citizen groups in Stockholm, im proving safety on roads and  decreasing  unnecessary e missions from  the  transportation system. Simple generalizations are, however, not conductible, since the sam ple consisted of long-distance travelers, that initially possessed particular interest in weather services. Another possible weakness of the study was th at early-season (Novem ber) and m id-season (January) in some respect are not com parable, due to occurrence of di fferent types of weather events and early season ¡°surprise¡± effects. Additi onally, the study had to t ackle the challenge of separating trust/comm itment from actual be havior. The latter was m anaged by dividing respondents into different groups due  to time of exposure to the se rvice and participation in the network. Furtherm ore, the choice of an ear ly-season (Nov ember) cas e and one m id-season (January) case offered some instruments for comparison.  However, high m anifestation of changed behavior , such cancelled trips to work  (2-5%) an d respondents strong con fidence in the service for pl anning change of equipm ent, illustrate the potential to  support ambitions to  decrease accide nt rates, in particular during  early seas on, maintain ef ficiency of  the tran sportation sy stem, and protect the environm ent as reducing emissions of both CO2 and harmful substances.  This work suggests that system s based on networ ks may trigger social incentives and drives  issued by social media technologies, and addresses some limitations in conventional technologies and services regarding trust into  the service provider, which m ay be essential for individual decision-making and planning in daily life. Results  on sustained, even increased trust, with time  of participation in the network, strongly support these ideas.    - 16 -Encouraged by the results presented in this paper, next step s should include new dim ensions of internal communication within th e network, whic h might additionally contribute to increased trust and changed decisions in daily life. Realization of the good ICT society requires participation of individuals, and networks can serve as basis for research collaboration, collection and distribution of useful data , also  with in ITS. Th e resu lts of our study show that  implementation and dissem ination of traffic w eather alerts can favor from  being based on collaboration, personal relations, and daily life concerns, in order to  be utilized during occasions with more severe weather, as trustworthiness and commitment, previously built within a network, might create an efficient channel for providing informant weather information in emergency-like situations.

Main themes investigated in three focus group interviews were (i) usage of system, (ii) functional limitations and trust, and (iii) driving behaviour and traffic safety. Findings imply negative experiences due to functional limitations (mainly associated with weather conditions) but also positive experiences (accidents avoided), changes in driving behaviour (e.g. a more relaxed driving style, increased use of directional indicators), as well as effects on traffic safety (e.g. longer distance to vehicles ahead and accident avoidance). Thus, collecting information on end-users? experiences of ADAS, in real traffic and over time, contributes to our overall understanding of the effects of ADAS and, in addition, provides valuable input to the further development and deployment of the systems.  Keywords: driver assistance systems; adaptive cruise control; blind spot monitor; forward collision warning; lane departure warning; driver state warning; human-machine interaction; driver behaviour; functional limitations    INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been argued to affect the safety, efficiency and comfort of the traffic system. Different types of studies have consequently been carried   2 out in order to evaluate the claimed effects and to support the further development of such systems as adaptive cruise control (ACC), blind spot monitor, forward collision warning (FCW), lane departure warning (LDW), and driver state warning. For instance, a simulator study by Rimini-Doering et al. (1) on drowsy drivers? performance indicated a reduction in the number of undesired lane departure events when driving with an LDW compared to without. A field test by de Ridder et al. (2) showed, on the other hand, that even though a large proportion of the participating (professional) drivers accepted the function and thought it to have positive effects their actual driving behaviour did not change over time. A study on FCW concluded that brake response time was reduced when the system was engaged, and that drivers remained further from a collision with the lead vehicle during the braking events (3).  Evaluations of ACC have, in contrast, demonstrated behavioural adaptations in terms of higher speed (4), decreased time headway (4), and larger brake force (5). With some exceptions, though, most studies appear to be either performed in a simulator or as semi-controlled field trials over a limited time. The main objective of the studies has been to conclude if there is an effect of the systems or not, and collection of subjective data has most often been limited to ratings of acceptance. Few studies have, however, investigated the drivers? actual experiences of driving with these systems and even less their experiences from using the systems over a longer period of time.      OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to investigate end-users? experiences of five driver assistance systems: adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitor, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and driver state warning (Table 1). The overall questions at issue were how interaction is realized between end-users and ADAS and what the implications of this interaction are on traffic safety.  Table 1. Overview of system functionality Function Description Adaptive cruise control Measures the distance to the vehicle ahead and based on this information, in cooperation with driver and vehicle inputs, controls speed and distance.  Blind spot monitor Monitors the blind spot and informs the driver (e.g. through a visible light or telltale) if there is a close object present.  Forward collision warning A system that warns the driver when there is an impending collision with the rear of a vehicle in front. Lane departure warning Administers a warning (e.g. by sound or vibrations) if the driver unintentionally leaves the lane.  Driver state warning Provides feedback to the driver suggesting a break if fatigue or distraction is detected.    METHOD Data collection and procedure In the study an exploratory approach (6) was taken. Data were collected by means of focus group interviews. A focus group interview is a group interview where a number of individuals are brought together for an in-depth discussion on a certain topic under the guidance of a moderator (7). The method is particularly suitable for exploratory research as it, for instance, brings different individuals into direct interaction with each other. In the discussion, the participants can pose questions to one another and compare opinions and experiences,   3 resulting in unification as well as polarization processes. These processes can reveal common denominators as well as identify differences between individuals and groups. As in most interview studies, the number of participants is normally small and may or may not reflect the larger population. Thus, the focus group interview is neither a basis for generalisations across a population, nor should the data be used for extrapolating a percentage or frequency (8). Rather the results should be used as a representation of the different opinions and/or experiences that exist within a group of individuals.   Altogether three focus group sessions (sessions A, B, and C) were completed in the study. All sessions were carried out in regular meeting rooms and after working hours. Furthermore, all group sessions were run applying the same procedure and following the same interview guide. The interview guide covered three main themes:   i. Usage of the systems, impressions of the systems, and situations where the systems are used. ii. System trust and functional limitations of the systems, experiences of the systems and possible system failures.  iii. Driving behaviour, experience of driving, perceived safety when using the systems.   The focus group interviews lasted for between one and a half and two hours.   Participants Eighteen drivers participated in the interviews, five to seven in each interview session (see Table 2). Drafting was done from the Swedish car registry. A first recruitment criterion was that the drivers lived in one of two larger cities in Sweden, Gothenburg or Stockholm; a second was that they drove cars equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC). However, many of the participants? cars (mainly in sessions A and B) were also equipped with other driver assistance systems, i.e. blind spot monitor, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and driver state warning. A majority of the participants drove cars equipped with automatic gearbox and estimated their annual driving to exceed 2500 kilometres.  The cars were of year models stretching from 2008 to 2010.

The values for age distribution represent full years.   Analysis All sessions were tape-recorded for later transcription. A qualitative content analysis (9) of the collected data was carried out, based on the predetermined themes of the interview. From these main themes summarizing statements illustrating central ideas from the discussions were extracted and interpreted.     4 RESULTS  The findings from the focus group interviews include descriptions of negative experiences due to actual or assumed functional limitations as well as positive experiences, changes in driving behaviour, and implications on traffic safety.   ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL According to the focus group participants (Ps), the adaptive cruise control (ACC) was used mainly on rural roads with a speed limit exceeding 70 km/h. Some said that they used the ACC in high density traffic; while others claimed that they avoided using it in this situation. Furthermore, the Ps using it in high density traffic had some concerns about the tendency of other road-users overtaking and cutting-in between their vehicle and the vehicle ahead. In some cases this was experienced to lead to hard braking and activation of the forward collision warning (FCW) system (a more extensive account on ACC is provided in (10)).   One reason for activating the ACC was that the Ps felt it comfortable to drive with. Reasons for deactivating the system were associated with the functional limitations in the distance measuring system, causing the ACC to lose the target. Also, functional limitations connected to factors in the driving environment, such as specific road designs and weather conditions, were reported. For instance, the system did not function satisfactory in heavy fog, snowfall and rain. One of the Ps described how he reacted the first time he encountered ACC problems induced by snowfall:  ?? Last week when I went to Stockholm, there was a snowstorm, and the radar was freaking out, and I had no chance to stop and the cruise control was totally gone, and I had to drive manually, and it felt a bit like that, and I stopped somewhere and wiped away what I saw, snow, and a few minutes later the same problem again??      Experiences of functional limitations were reported also when driving on road with specific designs, such as curvy roads and roundabouts. For instance when a vehicle ahead made a turn, the ACC was reported to lose it and, as a consequence, the car started to accelerate. Another example concerning the same traffic situation was that when the ACC found a target moving in the same direction but in the adjacent lane, it braked the car. Overtaking was yet another concern for the Ps. They perceived a delay of some seconds before their car started to accelerate and requested a more immediate response. The Ps felt that when they decided to overtake another vehicle, they already knew that they had clear headway. However, the ACC did not accelerate until the driver already had changed lanes. Nevertheless, even if the Ps appeared dissatisfied they still demonstrated an understanding of the described problems, and in order to cope with the situations they appeared to adopt different strategies, for instance to temporarily override the system using the gas pedal. Some Ps reported that when they were new to the ACC and first began to use it they had applied other strategies. For instance they had evaluated strategies such as restarting the system. One P stated that he had actively ?pushed? the system in order to get to know the functionality and limits of the ACC.   Some Ps meant that the ACC always adopts fail safe behaviour, thus never leads to fatal consequences, while other Ps noted that there was a risk involved ? if there is an overreliance in the system:     5 ?Well this morning, if I had not been so used to driving with ACC and FCW, I probably would have been more aware of what was in front. If I had only had ACC I would have crashed, I had false security ahead.?   Although the Ps, in general, seemed to trust the ACC, some statements indicated that their trust was dependent on their ability to resume manual control. That the ACC was regarded as an aid, not as a substitution, was revealed in different statements:   ?The ACC is /? / a helping aid. I have full supervision, I brake when I feel that it is too close (referring to a vehicle ahead). I do it myself. I don?t trust it (referring to the system) 100 per cent. If I feel it is too close, and I know that I personally have set a long distance, but if I feel that it does not brake in time, then I do it myself. It is not as if I just sit there and let the ACC drive.?   Furthermore, the results indicate that ACC had a positive safety effect on the Ps? overall driving behaviour. The Ps reported for instance that it was more convenient to stay in the right lane when using the ACC compared to not using it. The reason given was that during manual driving, it requires less effort to change lane and overtake another vehicle than to manually adjust speed and distance over a period of time in relation to a vehicle ahead. When the ACC was active there was no, or at least less, effort associated with manual adjustment of speed and distance since the ACC was taking care of these tasks. Other claims by the Ps were that the ACC promoted a smoother and less stressful driving style. This behaviour can be partly attributed to the drivers? overtaking pattern, e.g. choosing not to overtake. The Ps also indicated that they had developed a better sense of how to choose the distance to the vehicle ahead also when driving manually. Another reported notion was the positive transfer of effects (e.g. behaviour associated with choice of distance to vehicle ahead) also when driving other vehicles not equipped with these systems. However, there were also those Ps that reported negative transfer effects. They claimed to be so accustomed to their own car and the ACC system that when they drove a car with a conventional cruise control (i.e. a system that keeps speed constant) they expected it to function as the ACC. This resulted in them taking action later than they normally would in situations where they needed to brake and manually adjust their speed. Some found it so confusing that they never used the cruise control and other support systems when not driving their own car.   BLIND SPOT MONITOR Another system discussed was the blind spot monitor and differences in the Ps opinions and experiences could be noted. Some Ps reported, for instance, uncertainties regarding how, or even if, they perceived the information provided by the system. One participant explained: ?? I'm so d-n used to the lights so I do not see them; I do not even reflect upon them because they flash all the time?? and another said: ?I do see it but the eye is not drawn to it, you have to actively check it, give it an extra glance. I'm not so impressed by it.? Other Ps made clear that they had no problems noticing the blind spot indication. The difficulties noticing the indication were attributed the position of the indicators (which are placed in the door frame next to the rear-view mirrors) and, in addition, some Ps thought that the ability to perceive the information provided by the indicators was sensitive to different seat positions and ascribed this as a possible explanation to why there were different experiences about this matter; ?? There are different cars and different driving positions.?     6 Several Ps complained about false warnings and some of them reported failures (i.e. a vehicle is present but no warning is given) but there were also those Ps that argued that they had never been subjected to a failure:   ?I have never experienced this with the blind spot monitor, which I am surprised that ? S-t there was a car ? but then it flashes, it flashes too much. It has never tricked me to change lanes when there's a car there. It is too sensitive and flashes too much, you become jaded?   Even if false warnings were perceived as annoying switching off the system because of the false warnings were not reported.   False warnings were for some Ps associated with functional limitations of the system. Statements regarding these type of limitations also included various notions on the system being sensitive to weather conditions. For example reduced functionality during rain, snow and fog was reported but also that the sun, from certain angles, disrupted the system. One P explained: ?? And in fog, then the sign that says that the system is out of function lights up, and that is when you really need it because you do not see the cars.? while another P stated, plain and simple: ?When it rains you cannot use it.?  When the topic of trust was discussed most of the Ps agreed that the blind spot monitor was not to be trusted on its own: ?When you are about to change lanes then you check manually, you cannot trust it.? They explained that they only used the monitor to gain extra information, whilst still applying ?normal driving behaviour? such as glances over the shoulder and in the rear-view mirrors before changing lanes: ?I am still left in the old driving style. You turn your head and check. You don?t trust the system alone?.    In the case of the blind spot monitor, the Ps had some ideas on improvements. One suggestion was that the system should only indicate vehicles in the blind spot when the drivers? intention is to change lanes: ?Maybe it should just be informing when you, yourself, are indicating a turn. It will not inform when cars pass when there is no intention that you yourself are going to change.? Another thought was related to the design of the interface (in this case the light indicator in the rear-view mirrors). The suggestion was to use monitors instead of lights: ?What I would like to have, it is that the cameras would be linked to a small monitor or TV-screen in order to see what is in the blind spot that I cannot see, instead of that red light?.?     FORWARD COLLISION WARNING In general, the discussion on the Ps experiences of the forward collision warning system (FCW) did not only concern FCW as some of the Ps also had an auto brake function and a distance alert system (i.e. a convenience feature that helps the driver maintain a selected time-gap). Overall, though, the Ps appreciated the functionality of the system and many of them shared stories about how the systems had prevented them from getting involved in accidents. One of the Ps provided the following account:    ?When it saved me once, I sat and messed about with the stereo to adjust the sound and things like that, but suddenly I heard the world howl. It was the first time I heard this. And it braked automatically too /?/. I don?t think I?d ever been able to stop the car, been able to stop the car in as short a distance. It was the first time for me, meaning that the whole system was up and running. I put both hands on the steering wheel, and the steering wheel almost hit me in the stomach   7 and I could bet that right now, it will crash, but it did not. Because the brakes felt so soft when it went down as well. It was awesome.?  Another P reported on a similar incident:   ?There was a queue ? it came to a grinding halt in the queue, in principle, and it was a car that turned in just in front of me, so the room I had there was not there any longer, but it was ... Well, it (the system) was activated and it is, as you say, you automatically stamp on the brakes and then it will go into this other system as well so that it takes a grinding halt /?/ I was most worried that the car behind would crash into me as I came to halt so quickly.?  Being exposed to the activation of the collision warning had resulted in some Ps to become more safety conscious and also to reflect more ? even though not always being able to specify exactly what their concerns were: ?You become safety conscious somehow.? However there were also some reports indicating the Ps? dissatisfaction with the system. For example, one opinion was that the warnings were too frequent and inadequate given the drivers? interpretation of the traffic situation: ?They flash when they are not supposed to flash?. The Ps were also concerned that access to a collision warning system (in combination with e.g. experience of adaptive cruise control) could lead to false safety. This was exemplified by one P who said that he, in some situations, was indeed paying less attention to the road ahead.    LANE DEPARTURE WARNING The discussion on the lane departure warning system (LDW) was not very extensive. However, a reported (positive) effect of access to LDW was an increased inclination to use their directional indicators: ?Lane departure warning induces the use of indicators, unconditionally, because you don?t want (to hear) the sound. Therefore you become better at using the indicator?. This is an advantage.?  A main issue debated was the functional limitations of the system and the Ps provided several examples of driving conditions when the LDW was not functioning at a satisfying level. One P said, in relation to road infrastructure, that ?On minor roads with centre lines, then I lie and cut and then it is not an option. It means that I won?t use it (LDW) at all?. Other Ps claimed old road markings to be a problem but also that the system was too ?sensitive?. One P provided an example of a situation where there was a road construction site and a redirection of traffic forced him to cross a line.   There were also reports of functional limitations connected to weather condition, such as snow and rain. Altogether, the main impression of the LDW as conveyed by the Ps was that they had stopped using it, either entirely due to the shortcomings mentioned or during those conditions where its function was limited. One P explained that the situations where he could see a need for such a system were the same situations where it did not function in a satisfying way.    DRIVER STATE WARNING Concerning the driver state warning most of the Ps had been subjected to alerts by the system while driving. Their experiences of these alerts were mixed but it was evident that many had problems understanding what actually activated the system:     8 ?I have wondered what the h-l it is. Somehow it can go off even if I have the engine turned off and have been standing still for one hour, and I am just about to start again. Then it shows, that icon, which I have never understood, how it calculates in the system.?   During the discussions various ideas emerged, for example that activation depended upon the pace of steering wheel movement or how the steering movement was performed. It was also suggested that it run on a timer function (e.g. that it alerts after a few hours no matter what) or that it depended upon speed.   The discussion provided examples also of when the system had provided accurate warnings ? as experienced by the drivers. One of the Ps described for instance the following situation:    ?It warned me after ten or fifteen minutes, but at that occasion I had my son in the car and it was a d-n howl, and there was something wrong. Then I had to get into the driving again and concentrate on it, instead of scolding at him, so it was a good warning.?  Some Ps had, for different reasons, tried to force the system to activate: ?This system, it has only appeared once for me, in real life when I was tired. Otherwise I have to simulate to get it to appear.?   As was the case regarding the FCW, some of the Ps got engaged in a discussion about the ?sensitivity? of the driver state warning system and complained on the matter. One P commented that: ?I was driving at a speed of about 120 kilometres per hour, and it warned me every 15 minutes, and I?m going crazy. I can?t stop for a cup of coffee every quarter?, and another P had a similar experience: ?Once you get into speeds of 120 kilometres per hour and above, then the slightest move activates it.? However, again there were also those Ps that did not agree and explained that it was possible to adjust the sensitivity of the system: ?? using that little knob /?/ You turn it and when you come to the icon then you can adjust it by using the plus and minus buttons.? This did not appear to be an option apparent to all Ps.   DISCUSSION The study revealed that drivers, i.e. the end-users of driver assistance systems, have a lot of information to share on how they interact with and experience the systems with which their cars are equipped. It was for instance apparent that the drivers had different views on, as well as different understanding of the functionality of the respective systems and also used them differently. One indication of differences in understanding was that different systems that addressed warnings based on the longitudinal relationship to vehicles ahead were, by some Ps, discussed as though one system, i.e. one system with many functions rather than separate systems with separate functions. There was also a discrepancy between the Ps understanding and how manufacturers describe these systems (e.g. one system that warns if the distance is too short, one system that warns if the distance is so critical that an accident is likely to happen if no action is taken, and one system that brakes). This became evident for instance when Ps were debating the forward collision warning system and described frequent warnings that most likely originated from a distance alert system.   In addition, the Ps faced difficulties understanding what activated some of the systems. In particular this applied to the driver state warning which seemed to result in frustration when it warned. It appears as though there was a lack of compatibility between what the system   9 detected as indicators of fatigue and how the drivers experienced their state. Dewar and Olson (11) have described how different measures, such as subjective ratings, physiological measures, and performance measures can be used to measure fatigue and other driver states but also the problem associated with the lack of correlation between them. Changes in subjective fatigue may precede changes in physiological measures or may follow them. It is possible that the discussed driver state warning system?s detection of fatigue precedes the driver?s awareness, thus picking up on fatigue at an earlier state and further that this could have a positive effect on, for instance traffic safety. On the other hand, the point of equipping a car with such a system is lost if the driver, in frustration, decides to turn it off. This emphasizes the importance of that drivers develop an understanding, a mental model, of how the systems work and, furthermore the importance of designing the system with a higher degree of transparency (cf. 12). If a driver assistance system and the way in which it behaves is not understood by the driver, a correct warning may be perceived as a false warning and a highly reliable system can be subject of mistrust. It could be argued that a great deal of trust is required from the individual in order to accept a system with, for instance, the assumed discrepancy between the system?s assessment of the driver?s state and the driver?s subjective judgment of the same.   Another aspect of the Ps? experience of driver state warning is the frequency of alerts. Some drivers reported frequent warnings from the system whilst others did not appear to activate the system at all. This can be understood as differences in driving behaviour and driving style or as though some drivers were always rested and focused when driving whereas other drivers were, in fact, often fatigued and distracted. If the latter belongs to the same category as the ones who find the frequency of received warnings annoying, as some of the Ps did, the result can be that the system is turned off by those who most need it the most - in particular if the reason for the warning is not understood. Although it was suggested during the focus group discussions that the situation could be solved by adjusting the sensitivity of the driver state warning, this is not a valid option. The specific implementation of the system in the Ps cars does not include a feature that allows adjusting the sensitivity. There could be several explanations for the suggestion but fundamentally the situation showed that there are different views on system functionality and some of them are incorrect.    The interviews also provided several examples of when the functionality of the respective systems was limited. However, most of the functional limitations mentioned during the discussions are well known and manufacturers actually inform about them in the user manuals. Even so, drivers had obviously tried to use the systems under conditions that are communicated not to be compatible with the system as had some Ps actively explored the systems in order to develop further knowledge. Again, this is interpreted as a lack of knowledge and understanding of the system and the difficulties that the drivers? face in developing this understanding.  The systems discussed were not only understood but were also used in different ways. Based on the Ps descriptions, it appeared as though the ACC was predominantly used for comfort. The blind spot monitor was used as an extra source of information while the Ps still applied their usual behaviour in that they turned their head and checked the mirrors. With the reported concerns regarding false alarms and missed objects in mind, using the system instead of looking over the shoulder and checking the mirrors could result in critical consequences. The FCW was, on the other hand, argued to have helped the Ps to avoid collisions, i.e. a direct positive effect on traffic safety. There were also reports on changes in driving behaviour as a result of using the systems, as for example changes in how the Ps kept their distance to   10 vehicles ahead and how they applied a more calm style of driving. It has been explained in traffic safety literature (e.g. 13) that calmer driving (in terms of decreased speed) reduces the likelihood of accident involvement. Thus, it can be deduced that collision warning?together with ACC and distance alert?brings positive safety effects of a more secondary nature.   Also the reported increased use of the directional indicators, as a consequence of access to LDW, could have positive effects on traffic safety. This topic is addressed, for instance by Evans (13) who discusses the benefits of using directional indicators to communicate one?s intentions to other road-users. Drivers normally lower their speed in order to execute a turn. If this intention to change lane and the associated decreased speed are indicated by the use of directional indicators the vehicles behind are informed and can apply a safer following behaviour. However, according to the interviews, LDW is turned off by some drivers due to its lack in reliability ? as were indeed other systems and for the same reasons. Thus, to achieve the desired positive effect on traffic safety the systems need to become more reliable and, for instance, remain functional during poor but still fairly common weather conditions.   However, the results also indicate that the Ps were more forgiving regarding the flaws of blind spot monitors than those of the LDW. This might have to do with the LDW system interfering with the driving task to a greater extent than does the blind spot monitor. It can also be an effect of the audio-warnings being perceived as more disturbing than warnings conveyed by a warning light. The results could also reflect that the Ps in the focus group interviews, i.e. the study sample, encompassed other experiences than the general user population. Since these driver assistance systems are (as yet) quite rare and new to the broader market it could be hypothesized that the Ps belonged to the category ?early adopters? (14). One of the characteristics of such early adopters are that they are more favourable towards new technology as such and, hence, demonstrate a higher level of acceptance of technical flaws. The further dissemination of ADAS may pose other and additional requirements regarding for instance system reliability and transparency etc. as additional categories of users, i.e. the so called ?large majority? and ?laggards? (cf. 14) may be less tolerant.   CONCLUSIONS The aim of this study was to explore end-users self-reported interaction with and experience of driver assistance systems and the implication on traffic safety. The information was collected in focus group interviews from a limited number of drivers why generalisations across the whole population of drivers is not feasible. Nevertheless, in addition to providing a basis for generating ideas, hypotheses, and scientific questions for further research regarding the use of ADAS, the interviews provided important information on and examples of experiences made by end-users and thoughts that exist in the user community.   Based on the results from the focus group interviews the following conclusions are drawn:    ? There were reported positive effects of the drivers? access to the systems including calmer driving, increased use of indicators, as well as accidents being avoided.  ? There are difficulties for end-users of driver assistance systems to fully understand how the systems work. This results in different (re)actions, including negative ones such as frustration or even turning systems off.  ? End-users of driver assistance systems use the systems differently. One of the reasons is differences in their understanding of the functionality of the systems.    11 ? The further development of driver assistance systems should emphasize not only technical issues (dealing with reliability and technical limitations) but also design for increased understanding.  ? Designing driver assistance systems with a higher level of system transparency may play a key role in solving some of the identified issues.

Vehicles cooperate by exchanging messages about their state, such as position, speed, direction, and brake status.  The safety system can detect certain scenarios that trigger warning messages to the driver. Vehicle position and direction are critical pieces of the information exchange.  GPS serves well to provide this information in most environments.  However, there are environment features, such as urban canyons and foliage, that can limit the availability of adequate positioning accuracy.  This can create concerns about the spread of cooperative vehicle safety.   This paper aims to put those concerns into perspective by starting from recent experimental data on GPS performance in various environments and weighing it using the US government road use data.  It also calculates the improved level of positioning performance achievable in the future based on surveying international plans for expansion of satellite-based positioning systems, analyzing the latest trends in sensor technology, and considering the potential revealed by recent research. INTRODUCTION MOTIVATION Vehicle positioning is one of the two technologies critical for operation of cooperative vehicle safety systems (also known as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) safety systems).  V2V safety systems (see (1)(2)(3) for examples) continuously exchange vehicle information, such as vehicle positions, among neighboring vehicles, allowing them to anticipate potential collisions and warn the driver to avoid them.  The other key technology is Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), defined by a set of standards facilitating communication between vehicles (4)(5). Accurate vehicle positioning is important because without it confident estimations of vehicle paths, and thus estimations of collision potentials, cannot be made.  Positioning accuracy that distinguishes between vehicles passing each other or colliding, termed lane-level accuracy, is -2-  required in many collision avoidance scenarios.  Lane-level accuracy can have different numerical expressions.  The error bound chosen here (also elsewhere, for example (6)) is 1.5 m.  The threshold of 1.5 m is useful mainly because a vehicle driving down the center of a 3 m lane would still be correctly classified in that lane even with positioning errors of up to 1.5 m in any direction from its true location.  In the US, lanes with width ? 3.0 m are used 91% of the time (based on calculations using data from (7), (8)).  The lane-level accuracy is further fully specified here using a 95% statistical bound as ¡°1.5 m 95%¡±, which allows a small portion of positions to fall outside the chosen error bound. The main source of positioning information have been devices receiving the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.  GPS is maintained by the US government, but other countries are developing similar systems.  A generic term for any such system is Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).  A GNSS receiver provides its optimal performance when it has an unobstructed view of the sky.  Obstructions such as overpasses, trees, and buildings can increase the error or prevent position output altogether.  This makes GNSS performance environment-dependent and can cause concerns about the expected reliability of V2V-based safety systems.  This paper quantifies the concerns by presenting an assessment of current practical automotive lane-level positioning technology capabilities and alleviates the concerns by forecasting the expected future capabilities. APPROACH The data from a GPS availability study commissioned by the Vehicle Safety Communications 2 Consortium (VSC 2) of automotive manufacturers, and detailed in (9), will be used as a starting point for the assessment of current positioning performance that is practical for automotive use.  The roads and environments that VSC2 selected for its data collection will be validated against the US road-use statistical data from US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (10)-(13).  If there is a difference between the VSC2 environments and those suggested by the FHWA data, then the positioning availability percentage from VSC2 will be adjusted to derive the availability percentage considered here as an assessment of the current positioning performance. The trends in GNSS systems and automotive sensors will then be presented in the section ¡°Benefits of Growing GNSS and Trends in Sensor Technology.¡±  This knowledge will allow making assumptions about the performance of future positioning devices in order to forecast estimates of future automotive lane-level positioning availability in the section ¡°Positioning Performance Forecasts.¡± VSC2 GPS FIELD STUDY The comprehensive VSC2 field study (9)(2)(6), among other results, provides an assessment of relative lane-level automotive-grade GPS (single-frequency, with WAAS corrections) positioning availability based on 45 hours of driving in various environments.  It was commissioned by the VSC2 consortium of automotive manufacturers during the Vehicle Safety Communications ¨C Applications (VSC-A) project (2)(3) and executed by the University of Calgary.  The proportioning of environments in the study is shown in Table 1 with environments defined in Table 2. -3-  Category Time collected % Deep Urban 1:39:54 3.7% Major Urban Thruway  9:50:03 21.8% Major Rural Thruway  8:40:09 19.2% Major Road 8:10:40 18.1% Local Road 6:30:48 14.4% Interstate/Freeway 9:04:51 20.1% Mountains 1:08:32 2.5% Total 45:04:57 100% Table 1.

VSC2 GPS Availability Study Environment Definitions, Data from (9) VSC2 assessed relative position resulting from application of two different methods (simple difference of absolute positions (DPOS) and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)) between three receiver type combinations: receivers on both vehicles are automotive-grade, both scientific-grade, or one automotive and one scientific.   VSC2¡¯s availability results are listed in Table 3.  The result selected here as closest to representing current automotive performance comes from DPOS applied between automotive-grade receivers.  It gives a lane-level availability, over a diverse mix of environments, of 88%.  The road-level availability for the same combination, quantified as 5 m, is 97%.  Note that in dense urban environments the errors can be far beyond this, in the order of tens of meters. -4-  Receivers Proc.

VSC2 GPS Availability Study Results (AW = survey grade single frequency receiver, BW = automotive quality single frequency receiver, FA = availability of any position, FAWE = availability of position with noted accuracy, AT = along,  XT = across), Reproduced from (9) Automotive-grade DPOS is used as a starting point for further estimation because it is simple and likely to be the most common initial implementation.  Its performance lies between the extremes of performance given by applying DPOS between different receiver types (59% availability) and by applying DPOS between two scientific-grade receivers (92%).  Methods similar to RTK can enhance performance when the receivers are of mixed types, but they require that both vehicles see some common satellites and exchange more information.  Advantages of RTK measured by VSC2 are taken into account for future projections. FHWA US ROAD USE STATISTICS The only readily available source with data on actual categorized road use for the entire US is FHWA (10)-(13).  The FHWA data, published yearly, includes the length of all public roads in the US classified according to their ¡°functional system¡± type, as well as frequency of type use expressed in yearly miles of travel (10).  The FHWA road classes and road use numbers for 2007 are listed in Table 4.  The numbers change yearly, but the proportioning of classes is not expected to change much. -5-  Road Type Acronym For Use in This Paper ?

FHWA Highway Statistics for 2007, Data from(10) For our purposes, a classification of road use according to environment type is desired, while on the other hand the FHWA road classifications are according to road function, which is practically about road size and expected volume.  The road types are defined in a complex way (11) that defies a concise summary apart from pointing out that the road types form a hierarchy (Figure 1) where at the higher levels are the wider roads that carry larger volumes of traffic between larger population concentrations.  Descriptions in Table 5 provide some guidance too.  It is expected that classifications according to environment and according to road size still have some correlation.  Since this is the data closest to the data actually needed that could be found, it is used here as much as possible, but its limitation with respect to the purposes of determining real-world environment proportioning should be kept in mind.  These limitations will become apparent in the descriptions of the estimation approach that follow.  Figure 1.  FHWA Road Category Hierarchy, Reproduced from (15) -6-   Table 5.  FHWA Category Descriptions, Reproduced from (13) CURRENT POSITIONING PERFORMANCE PROPOSED ENVIRONMENT CATEGORIES In order to emphasize the importance of road surroundings and to relate VSC2 (Table 2) and FHWA (Table 5) categories, a new set of uniform and symmetric environment categories was created, as listed in Table 6.

Environments Defined in Terms of Features, Inspired by (18) DENSE URBAN ENVIRONMENT PORTION ESTIMATION Applying FHWA road use data to determine proportioning of different GPS conditions likely to be encountered by a typical driver is challenging in general, but especially so when trying to determine the prevalence of Dense Urban environments since they occur within many of the FHWA road classes.  It is important to know how common Dense Urban environments are because GPS-only positioning devices perform poorly in them.  Including a larger portion of -7-  them in the overall assessment reduces positioning availability.  Several alternative methods for estimating the prevalence of Dense Urban environments are presented in this section. Using US Census City Population and Vehicle Use One estimation method is based on the ratio between the combined population of several dense US cities and the total US population, adjusted by the national statistics of vehicle use for journey to work.  The ratio is meant to capture the proportion of the population living in Dense Urban environments and the adjustment is meant to account for the non-driving population.  The top ten US cities by population, listed in Table 7, account for 8.5% of the US population and include most of the main examples of Dense Urban environments.  According to census data (16), 86.5% of people in the US drive a car, truck, or van to work.  Adjusting by 86.5% yields 7.3% as the extreme high bound for the estimate of Dense Urban environments.   City  Population in 2000  New York,  NY  8,008,278  Los Angeles, CA 3,694,820 Chicago, IL 2,896,016 Houston,  TX  1,953,631  Philadelphia, PA 1,517,550 Phoenix, AZ 1,321,045 San Diego,  CA  1,223,400  Dallas,  TX  1,188,580  San Antonio, TX 1,144,646 Detroit, MI 951,270 Table 7.  Top 10 US Cities By Population, Data from (17) This method only provides a high-bound estimate since the number of cities selected for the calculation affects the results and entire cities are typically not in Dense Urban environments.  Furthermore, populations in dense urban centers are more likely to use public transportation, in which case the 86.5% figure produces an overestimate.  In an attempt to approach a realistic number, 4% was used in calculating assessments, which is slightly more than half of the 7.3% estimate, or equivalent to selecting only four of the top 10 cities (e.g., New York, Chicago, Phoenix, and Detroit).  Note that each percent increase in the Dense Urban proportion yields an approximate 0.6% decrease in overall availability due to the difference in availability between Dense Urban (~30%) and other environments (~90%).  Thus using a 7% estimate instead of 4% would reduce the overall availability by 1.5%. Using Housing Density from the US Census Ideally, the dense urban proportion would be determined by combining building density data with road use data.  That is, knowing the heights of buildings surrounding the roads and the road use frequency nationwide would provide the dense urban proportion.  However, such data was not found. One alternative that could be used is the US Census data on housing unit density, which is available down to a census block level.  The census block varies in size but has a well-defined geography and usually corresponds to about a city block in urban areas.  The US Census divides the country into census blocks and provides a housing unit density for each.  This provides sufficient detail for assessing a geographic distribution of population density.  The drawbacks are that it only covers residential building use and it¡¯s unclear how to relate the -8-  frequency of road use to the census blocks.  Regardless, this method is still under consideration and may be used in the future if its limitations can be resolved. Using GPS Conditions Data from a National Mapping Organization Another approach that could yield a high quality estimate would be using GPS conditions data from a national mapping organization that regularly collects GPS data while driving nearly all roads in the US.  This data, such as Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP, a measure of satellite geometry) and the number of visible satellites, are reported by all GPS receivers.  Applying appropriate thresholds would allow determining the portion of challenging GPS conditions, which would then be assigned to Dense Rural and Dense Urban environment categories depending on the FHWA road class. VSC2 RESULTS ADJUSTED FOR US DRIVING STATISTICS VSC2¡¯s proportioning of time spent in different environments (Table 1) was not originally verified against data on actual road use statistics.  As summarized in Table 4, the FHWA study of actual road use in the US (10)-(13) was compared with VSC2 road and environment selection.  The VSC2 data was adjusted (Figure 2) to mirror FHWA statistics and make it representative of GPS conditions expected to be encountered by a US driver.  The estimated adjustment results in a slight lowering of lane-level availability from 88% to 86%.  This section describes how the adjustment was derived.  Figure 2.  Process for Adjusting VSC2 Results with US Road Use Statistics -9-  Step 1: Distribute FHWA Classes Over Proposed Environment Classes As the first step in the adjustment process, the definitions of FHWA categories were compared with the definitions of categories presented in the ¡°Proposed Environment Categories¡± section to arrive at a preliminary proportioning of the proposed categories.  The proposed environments are defined in terms of surroundings¡¯ openness to the sky.  This is appropriate for their goal of classifying the conditions for GNSS-based positioning.  The FHWA classifications are defined purely in terms of road types, which is appropriate for its goals of monitoring road usage.  The difference in the two classification approaches can make finding the correspondence between them challenging.  For example, the Dense Urban environment could contain various FHWA types of road and, without resorting to other information, there seems to be no objective way to apportion FHWA types to that environment.  For this special case, the 4% estimate, which is explained in the ¡°Dense Urban Portion Estimation¡± section, was used.  Simpler estimations were made in other cases.  For example, FHWA¡¯s classes ¡°Interstates¡± and ¡°Other Freeways and Expressways¡± are simply classified as sparse (from Table 4, UI + UIO = 23%).  The expectation that portions of other road classes also go through sparse environments calls for entering ¡°>23¡±.  The Moderate environment is expected to be dominant urban environment and thus the balance of environments (42%) is assigned to it.  The Rural environment proportioning was done using a similar type of reasoning.

Table 8.  Preliminary Apportioning of FHWA Road Classes to Proposed Environment Categories Step 2: Distribute VSC2 Classes over Proposed Classes The next step was to distribute VSC2 environments across proposed environments, the results of which are listed in Table 9.  This was done based on comparison of definitions of the two types of categories.  Some distribution decisions were easy to justify, such as assigning 34% of VSC2¡¯s Interstate/Freeway category to Rural Sparse and 66% to Urban Sparse based on the Interstate/Freeway environment being mostly open and the split resulting simply from FHWA¡¯s 34-66% rural-urban split.  Other assignments required more deliberation. -10-  Proposed Environments Expressed as Combina tion of VSC2 's Environments  Rural Sparse  80% of Major Rural Thruway + 34% of Interstate/Freeway + 17% Major Roads       Moderate  80% of Mountains  + 20% of Major Rural Thruway  + 17% of Major Roads  + 17% Local Roads  Dense  20% of Mountains  + 17% of Local Roads  Urban  Sparse  20% of Major Urban Thruway  + 66% Interstate/Freeway  + 7% Major Roads   Moderate  80% of Major Urban Thruway  + 59% Major Roads  + 66% Local Roads  Dense  100% of Deep Urban  Table 9.

FHWA Road Classes Distributed over VSC2 Environment Categories Step 4: Determine Proportion of Proposed Environments from VSC2 and FHWA At this stage, the portion of each proposed category, as percent of total, can be determined as the sum of fractions of VSC2 categories assigned to it in Step 2, weighted by their FHWA portions assigned in Step 3.  For example: Rural Sparse portion  of all environments (%) =  = (Major Rural Thruway fraction)(Major Rural Thruway portion) +  + (Interstate/Freeway fraction)(Interstate/Freeway portion) +  + (Major Roads fraction)(Major Roads portion) = = (0.80)(0.13) + (0.34)(0.32) + (0.17)(0.08) = = 23%  In some cases, for instance when the VSC2¡¯s Mountains and Deep Urban environments were involved, such calculations could not be applied; therefore, adjustments were made using Table 8 as a guide.  The resulting proportions are shown in Table 11 in the ¡°Portion %¡± column. -11-  Environment Current GPS-Only  Lane-Level Availability (%) Proposed Category  Z Portion (%) Rural Sparse 34  F 22  FZ  94  CZ  Moderate 10  FZ  88  CZ  Dense 2 ¡þ 80  CZ  Urban Sparse 66  F 26  FZ  94  CZ  Moderate 36  FZ  82  CZ  Dense 4 C 31  CZ  Total 100 100 86   P Z Defined in ¡°Proposed Environment Categories¡± section, based on adaptation of (18) .

CZ  Determined using VSC2 availability results (9) weighed using estimated contribution of VSC2-defined environment categories to proposed environment categories. P Determined by summing environment-specific availabilities weighted using the ¡°Portion (%)¡± column. Table 11.  Lane-Level Availability vs.  Proposed Environment Step 5: Determine Availability for Each Proposed Environment The final scaled availabilities were obtained by including the VSC2 availabilities for specific VSC2 environments from (9) into the weighing of the previous step.  Using the Rural Sparse example, availability was determined as follows: Rural Sparse availability =  = ((Major Rural Thruway fraction)(Major Rural Thruway portion)(Major Rural Thruway availability) +  + (Interstate/Freeway fraction)(Interstate/Freeway portion)(Interstate/Freeway availability) +  + (Major Roads fraction)(Major Roads portion)(Major Roads availability)/(Rural Sparse portion)) = = ((0.80)(0.13)(0.93) + (0.34)(0.32)(0.97) + (0.17)(0.08)(0.86))/(0.226) = = 94%  The results are shown in Table 11 under the ¡°Lane-Level Availability¡±.   Step 6: Determine Overall Availability The overall availability across all environments can then be determined as the sum of individual proposed environment availabilities, where each proposed environment is weighed by the driving portion of that environment with respect to total FHWA driving. Overall Availability =  = (22)(0.94) + (10)(0.86) + (2)(0.80) + (26)(0.94) + (36)(0.82) + (4)(0.31)  = 86% This slight difference between the original VSC2 availability of 88% and the adjusted availability of 86% validates that VSC2¡¯s environment selection reasonably reflects US conditions. -12-  2010 STATUS: LEVEL 0: CURRENT GPS-ONLY PERFORMANCE Based on the work described in the previous section, the currently practical automotive real-world lane-level positioning availability is 86%, where the only positioning sensor is a single-frequency, WAAS-corrected GPS receiver.  This value will be used as the starting point for further estimates.  Note that this number depends heavily on the test environment.  However, the previous section shows that the combination of test environments behind this particular number is representative of the US road use statistics. 2010 STATUS: LEVEL 1: AIDING FROM EXISTING VEHICLE SENSORS Incorporating information from other sensors already frequently available on cars is estimated to increase availability to 88%.  These sensors measure wheel distances and speeds, vehicle accelerations, and vehicle yaw rate, and are needed for systems such as Anti-Lock Braking (ABS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC).  Since the 2010 model year, ESC is already a standard feature on 88% of new cars and 100% of SUVs (20).  Its market presence will continue to grow since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration mandated ESC to be phased-in starting in 2009 and to be on all vehicles by 2012 (20).  This will, in turn, increase the prevalence of sensors useful for positioning.   The projected 88% availability is derived starting with VSC2 data and assumes that incorporating the aiding information can replace all positioning outages shorter than 15 s with errors statistics otherwise measured.  The 15 s threshold is arbitrary, but it is based on various studies of inertial aiding using automotive-grade sensors (21).  Automakers are expected to be able to achieve this performance level by integrating sensor data available on most current production models without adding new sensors or processors. BENEFITS OF GROWING GNSS AND TRENDS IN SENSOR TECHNOLOGY INCREASE IN NUMBER OF SATELLITES Increasing the number of satellites improves the chance that they will be visible to a receiver and would be beneficial in dense urban environments where buildings can block most of the sky.  In general, a receiver¡¯s ability to see more satellites reduces the dilution of precision (DOP), which is a measure of geometric difficulty (19)(24).  Typically, lower DOP reduces positioning errors and horizontal DOP (HDOP) affects horizontal errors.  However, many satellites in a small sliver of sky, such as in an urban canyon, are not much better than just a few. Also, multipath (signal reflections from buildings) introduces errors even when there is a sufficient satellite count. Thus other coping methods are still  required. As shown in Table 12, in addition to the American-operated GPS, other countries are developing GNSS systems.  In 2010, in addition to 30 GPS satellites (22), there were 23 GLONASS (Russian) satellites in orbit (23), although receivers taking advantage of both systems are not yet sufficiently common for automotive use.  There have been concerns about GLONASS receiving the necessary resources (24), and suggestions that Galileo (European) may make it less needed (24), but from a user point of view, more is better.  The Russian -13-  agencies say that the program is extended until 2020 and that a new program is in development for beyond 2020 (25).   Galileo is expected to be initially operational with 18 satellites in orbit by 2014 and fully operational with 30 satellites in 2016 (26).  Galileo plans have been delayed several times ¨C the goal to launch four operational satellites in 2005 was not met (24) and is now expected for 2011 (26) ¨C but Galileo is making progress: contracts were recently signed for full operational development (26). By 2015, a total of 82 GNSS satellites are expected from the combination of GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo.  By 2020, 111 should be in orbit from four different GNSS.  These plans may not all be realized, and additional satellites eventually stop yielding meaningful improvements, but the overall trend (Figure 3) suggests better future performance.  2010 GPS  2010 GNSS  2015 GNSS  2020 GNSS  Source  GPS  (US)  30  30  31  33  (22)  GLONASS  (Russ ia ) 0 23  24  24  (27)  Galileo  (Europe)  0 0 18  E1  27  E2  (26)  Compass  (China)  0 0 C1  4 C2  27  (28)  TOTAL  30  53  77  111   20¡ã 95% HDOP  5 ~2  ~1.5  ~1  (21)  E1  Th is is the number planned for 2014.  E2  Even though 30 satellites are planned to be in orbit by 2016, only the 27 active satellites are shown here (the 3 spares are excluded).  C1  There are some operational satellites in orbit at this time but receivers using them are not expected to be practically available. C2  Even though more than 14 satellites are planned for 2012, the count shown only includes the middle earth orbit satellites, which are the only ones expected to be useful globally (the others are expected to be useful only for regional services).  Table 12.  Active GNSS Satellites in Orbit, According to Plans of Governing Bodies  Figure 3.  Active GNSS Satellites in Orbit, According to Plans of Governing Bodies Adding GLONASS and Galileo lowers the North American 20¡ã 95% HDOP figure to 1.5 over most of the area and 2.0 for the entire area (21).  The current GPS-only open sky for HDOP -14-  has a mean of 1 and 99% of the time it is less than or equal to 1.6.  Assuming that a 20¡ã mask angle represents a moderately-obstructed environment, an HDOP that allows open-sky accuracy would be available much of the time even in a moderately obstructed environment.  The effects of additional GNSS systems on HDOP are summarized in Table 12 and Figure 4.  Figure 4.  Moderate Conditions Visibility and HDOP, Forecast based on Plans DUAL FREQUENCY MEASUREMENTS Adding measurements from another signal frequency allows better correction of ionospheric error.  This is a dominant source of overall error, typically ranging from 2 to 10 m, but can be as much as 150 m (21).  Dual frequency GPS measurements have so far only been possible for civilian use by an inventive phase-based approach applied to the encrypted military signal.  The complexity of this method limits its practical application to only scientific and surveying applications.   A new civilian GPS signal, L2C, is already on L2 on 9 satellites (29) and is planned to be fully available in 2016.  It will allow dual frequency measurements with simpler components.  It could also allow companies without sophisticated algorithms to join the competition in the dual-frequency market.  This suggests that coming of L2C will bring cheaper GPS dual-frequency receivers in the future and increased performance.   Two other new GPS civilian signals are planned.  L5 is intended for safety-of-life applications and planned to be fully available in 2019 (30).  The first launch of an L5 carrying satellite was in 2010.  L1C, for ¡°improved performance in challenged tracking environments¡± (30) is to be launched in 2014 and to be on 24 satellites by about 2021 (30). Additional frequencies also provide benefits for RTK.  Using differential carrier phase with all three signals, ¡°very high user accuracy (on the order of millimeters) can be rapidly obtained¡± (19). Galileo (planned to be fully operational by 2016) will also bring new signals for dual frequency use.  GPS and Galileo signal compatibility (non-interference) is specifically ensured (31).  The easiest signals to integrate with GPS receivers are Galileo¡¯s L1 and L5a because their frequencies are common to GPS and thus less hardware needs to be added (19) (21).  A dual frequency receiver that uses GPS L1 and Galileo L1 is expected to be better than -15-  a receiver that uses two GPS frequencies when time to resolve RTK ambiguity is measured (21). IMPROVED SIGNAL PROPERTIES Signal properties such as shorter code period, faster code rate, longer code length, and data-free signals improve positioning performance.  Some new GNSS signals will allow taking advantage of these properties.   A shorter code period, which is the same as a faster code rate, allows better isolation from multipath and thus less positioning error.  A faster code rate serves to reduce the effect of radio frequency interference (RFI).  Shorter code also allows better time resolution, and via multiplication by the speed of light, better ranging precision.  The trade-off is that the receiver has to sample at a higher sampling rate requiring more expensive hardware and higher power.  The planned GPS L5 code is 10 times faster than L1 (24)(33), as is the Galileo L5.  This provides better resolution in measuring pseudorange (0.03 m vs.  0.3 (24)).  Compared to L1, it also reduces (by 14 dB) the effect of RFI and provides better isolation from multipath (24).   A greater code length provides lower interference from other signals, including GPS signals, ground-based radio signals, and narrowband jamming signals.  However, it also demands greater computational requirements.  Due to its longer codes, and especially due to its data-free code, the new GPS L2C is easier to distinguish and track when weak and thus better for tree shaded environments and indoors where signals are weak (33)(34).  Galileo L1 and L5 also feature longer code lengths (19)(24). To remove the navigation data from a GPS signal the receiver must square the signal, which also inadvertently squares the received noise.  This degrades the signal-to-noise ratio and has the greatest effect when the ratio is already low, such as in a challenging environment.  Some new GNSS signals, including new GPS L2C and L5, and the coming Galileo L1 and L5, have data-free components that prevent the need for this squaring and thus enhance performance in weak-signal environments (19)(24). AIDING SENSORS TRENDS There is a widely recognized expectation for continued increase in the performance of inertial sensors combined with their decreasing cost (35) (37).  Micro-Electro-Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) show the most promise (36).  They are currently approaching the inertial measurement accuracy that is required for achieving lane-level positioning in challenging environments at a cost of less than two thousand dollars when using older inertial sensor technologies costs tens of thousands of dollars (37). One factor contributing to the strong expectation of continued increasing performance-per-cost ratios for inertial sensors is the US Department of Transportation¡¯s electronic stability control mandate that is being phased-in in 2009 and required for all vehicles in 2012 (20).  This will help ensure presence of inertial sensors on all new vehicles.  A recent report stated that the ¡°implementation of ESC systems would double between 2007 and 2012¡± and, as a result, ¡°sales of MEMS sensors for ESC would soar to $715 million by 2012, up from $378 million in 2006¡± (38).  MEMS technology is also benefiting from their application in high-volume consumer devices such as smart phones (37). -16-  Furthermore, there is an increasing prevalence of other positioning-relevant sensors in cars that are used for other applications, such as cameras for lane change warnings and radars for adaptive cruise control.  This is combined with strong academic research interest in the use of those sensors to enhance positioning (40). POSITIONING PERFORMANCE FORECASTS Both the current positioning performance assessment and the forecast of future performance are presented in Table 13.  The current and Level 1 numbers were explained in the ¡°Current Positioning Performance¡± section.  Levels 2 and 3 are estimated as described in this section.

Current and Forecast Relative Lane-Level Availability vs.  Environment and Technology -17-  2015 FORECAST: LEVEL 2: GNSS, MORE SIGNALS, AND CAMERAS Using a positioning device that employs an additional GNSS, such as GLONASS or Galileo, the new L2C GPS signal, and in-car cameras, is estimated to increase the lane-level availability to 93% (Table 13, column Level 2, bottom row).  This level is expected to be achievable for 2015 production.  This estimate is calculated based on expected error reductions resulting from lower horizontal DOP, dual-frequency use, properties of L2C, and vision-based positioning.  More specifically, the numbers for sparse environments are extrapolations from Level 1 based on HDOP reductions in Table 12.  For other environments, the numbers are interpolations between Level 1 and Level 3.  Level 3 performance is analyzed in detail in the next subsection. 2020 FORECAST: LEVEL 3: EVEN MORE SATELLITES AND BETTER SENSORS Taking advantage of other new GNSS systems and signals, as well as sensor trends, is estimated to allow 96% lane-level availability by 2020.  This estimate is derived from recently demonstrated experimental positioning systems and further benefits of DOP reductions, multiple frequencies, and enhanced signals. Sensors The proposed Level 3 is an integrated positioning system consisting of all primary sensing components in Table 14; at least one and preferably more than one secondary sensing component in Table 15; and when available, one or more tertiary sensing components from Table 16. Some of the proposed sensor characteristics have been proven near-sufficient in a multi-sensor system using single-frequency GPS, full MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), and wheel odometry, which was devised and tested by the authors in 2010 (39)(40).  Currently this performance is not practical for automotive production, but it may be expected by 2020.  More specifically, an IMU specification slightly better than in Table 14 would be sufficient in combination with other sensors listed here to achieve the estimated accuracy.  Depending on other available sensors, a LIDAR specification that is less demanding than in Table 16 could still be sufficient. Sensor  Specifics  Low -cost, improved -capability, multi-GNSS receiver Uses at least GPS with L2 and L5 signals, 2 additional systems (for example Galileo and GLONASS), regional free SBAS corrections wheel-odometry From 1 or preferably 4 wheels, pulses/rotation > 5, timestamping < 0.3 ms  Low -cost, improved -performance, full or partial MEMS IMU Output > 100 Hz; drift < 100 ¡ã/h; bias < 2 mg (from (40) ) Table 14.  Proposed Positioning System Level 3 Primary Sensors -18-  Sensor Specifics LIDARs, if already available on the car for other purposes Example: 1 LIDAR, 1 scanning plane, 1¡ã angular resolution, 180¡ã angular range, 80 m linear range, 0.1 m linear accuracy (from (40)) Cameras  Expected already on the car for other purposes ; at least one, but preferably several oriented in different directions. Radars  Expected already on the car for other purposes  Table 15.  Proposed Positioning System Level 3 Secondary Sensors Sensor Specifics Height maps, barometers, or other altimeters accuracy better than 1 m allows 3D positioning with one less satellite Geo -tagged image databases  More accurate clocks   Table 16.  Proposed Positioning System Level 3 Tertiary Sensors The required height maps (Table 16) are commercially available but they pose difficulties with regard to cost, storage/dissemination, and updating.  These difficulties could diminish or be resolved in the future.  There are two scenarios that could work together to make this happen.  One is availability of free height maps provided by users  or a government agency.   Examples are Open Street Map (41) and the TIGER database (42), respectively, but higher accuracy is required.  The other is free and ubiquitous availability of mobile internet that would allow their dissemination and updating.  Barometers, or other altimeters, could theoretically serve the same purpose as the height maps, but market demand is insufficient to spur further development.   Performance This section explains how the positioning performance estimate shown in Table 13 is derived.   The numbers for sparse environments and Dense Rural are extrapolations from Level 1 based on HDOP reductions in Table 12. Rural Moderate and Urban Moderate availabilities for the Level 3 solution are set to Rural Sparse and Urban Sparse availabilities for the Level 1 solution (95% and 96% respectively) as explained in the ¡°Increase in Number of Satellites¡± section.  In moderate conditions, HDOP with three GNSS starts to approach the HDOP in open-sky conditions with GPS only.  Based solely on the fact that this new HDOP only approaches and does not reach GPS-only HDOP in open sky, this estimate is somewhat optimistic.  However, the other improvements in Solution 3 over Solution 1 also yield better performance, making this estimate more realistic. Level 3 Dense Urban projections are based on the experimental positioning system tested in  (40) that showed 89% availability of 2 m accuracy, but is expected to do even better with improvements planned in (40). OTHER POTENTIAL Further positioning improvements are possible with potential practical availability of positioning-relevant databases, lane maps, and geo-tagged images; diverse novel approaches, -19-  such as DSRC-based and headlight-based ranging; and potential spread of position-aiding infrastructure (e.g., reference stations at critical intersections). CONCERNS The performance forecasts presented here depend on the continued commitment of government bodies across the world to continued maintenance and planned development of their respective GNSS systems.  In the past there have been delays (as with Galileo) and periods of neglect (as with GLONASS) and they should be expected possible in the future (19)(24).  However, the growing number of GNSS systems combined with increased integration of aiding sensors, continues to decrease the dependence on any one particular system. There are also other, much less likely risks.  One type is space-based or ground-based natural phenomena that disrupt satellite operation, as for example solar flares that have been known to disrupt GNSS for minutes at a time, but such disruptions are rare (43)(44).  Another possibility is geographically-limited denials of service due to international conflicts. A real and recent threat to GNSS service is coming from the growth of mobile communications and computing, which are raising the demand for frequency spectrum.  Allocation of frequencies near those of GNSS signals for use by powerful transmissions from ground-based antennas can overpower GNSS signals and make GNSS-based positioning unavailable near the antennas.  An example of this is the conflict between LightSquared, a potential provider of wireless broadband, and the GPS community, over the disruption to GPS service that is expected if LightSquared¡¯s full plans are realized (45).  LightSquared argues that it is the GPS industry¡¯s responsibility to ensure immunity to its use of non-GPS frequencies, while the GPS community points to imminent and wide-ranging disruption to a vital infrastructure component as well as the technical and economical impracticality (if not impossibility) of designing the protections and timely upgrading hundreds of millions of existing devices.  A comprehensive set of tests (45) recently demonstrated the potential for harm to GPS and LightSquared is currently considering compromises.  A possible consequence could be that future receivers will require more expensive hardware and may delay reaching some of the milestones outlined here.  However, it is reasonable to expect that the reliance on GPS in so many critical domains will motivate an acceptable solution.   CONCLUSIONS Although GNSS-based positioning performance depends highly on the test environment and the receiver technology, the results from a comprehensive VSC2 study were shown to be representative of automotive device performance in overall US driving conditions by using FHWA statistics.  The representative overall availability of lane-level positioning accuracy was found to be 86%.  Trends in GNSS systems and GNSS-aiding sensors were analyzed to derive estimates of automotive positioning performance expected to be practically achievable in the future.  The expectations are approximately 93% by 2015 and 96% by 2020 and are dependent on the realization of GNSS plans and diligent application of emerging technologies.  Regardless of actual performance levels and their timing, it appears that emerging technology may allow near ubiquitous lane-level positioning without additional road infrastructure.  Any gaps in positioning coverage in safety-critical intersections may be reduced through additional communication, reference, or aiding equipment placed at those intersections. -20-  REFERENCES (1)  Maile, M.  and Delgrossi, L., ¡°Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance System for Violations (CICAS-V) for Avoidance of Violation-Based Intersection Crashes,¡± National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC (2)  Ahmed-Zaid, F., Bai, F., Bai, S., Basnayake, C., Bellur, B., Brovold, S., Brown, G., Caminiti, L., Cunningham, D., Elzein, H., Hong, K., Ivan, J., Jiang, D., Kenney, J., Krishnan, H., Lovell, J., Maile, M., Masselink, D., McGlohon, E., Mudalige, P., Popovic, Z., Rai, V., Stinnett, J., Tellis, L., Tirey, K., VanSickle, S., ¡°Vehicle Safety Communications ¨C Applications (VSC-A) Final Report,¡± to be published by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (3)  Ahmed-Zaid, F., Bai, F., Bai, S., Basnayake, C., Bellur, B., Brovold, S., Brown, G., Caminiti, L., Cunningham, D., Elzein, H., Ivan, J., Jiang, D., Kenny, J., Krishnan, H., Lovell, J., Maile, M., Masselink, D., McGlohon, E., Mudalige, P., Rai, V., Stinnett, J., Tellis, L., Tirey, K., VanSickle, S.  ¡°Vehicle Safety Communications ¨C Applications (VSC-A) First Annual Report ¨C December 7, 2006 through December 31, 2007,¡± National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, DC, Sept.  2008 (4)  IEEE Computer Society, ¡°IEEE Standard for Information technology¡ªTelecommunications and information exchange between systems¡ªLocal and metropolitan area networks¡ªSpecific requirements Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications Amendment 6: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments,¡± IEEE Std.  802.11p- 2010, doi: 10.1109/IEEESTD.2010.5514475 (5)  SAE International, ¡°Surface Vehicle Standard ¨C Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) Message Set Dictionary,¡± SAE J 2735, November 2009.

Systematic Development of Positioning Requirements for Vehicle Applications  Scott Andrews Cogenia Partners, LLC  ABSTRACT Positioning requirements for ITS applications have typically been developed by examining the physical geometry of the environment in which the application is intended to operate. However, this approach does not account for the impact of statistically distributed errors in position measurement. As a result, it is not possible to apply conventional statistically based position accuracy specifications to these heuristically derived geometric requirements. This paper provides a decision based approach to apply measurement confidence intervals in the requirements development process in order to produce statistically usable system requirements. The process involves assessing the geometric regions where false negative and false positive positioning decisions may occur in the context of a statistically distributed position error measurement, and then assigning confidence based error radii based on the level of error that can be accommodated, and the impact of such error on the performance of the application. The result is a more systematic and defensible development of positioning requirements, and a clear understanding of the impact of position measurement errors.  INTRODUCTION Positioning requirements for automotive ITS applications are fundamentally rooted in decision making. Specifically, deciding if the user terminal is has reached a ?decision site?, whereupon the terminal will initiate the associated action. The location of the decision site depends entirely on the function of the application, and the resulting requirements depend on the implication of mis-locating the decision site by some physical distance.   The development of positioning requirements for position dependent applications has generally been based on a geometric assessment of the needs of the application. It has been assumed that these geometric requirements then represent the positioning accuracy  requirements for the positioning systems used to support the application. However, this approach does not address the statistical nature of errors present in practical positioning systems.  For example, an application may be seeking to stop a vehicle within some specified distance of a stop sign limit line. In order to properly specify the resulting requirements on positioning accuracy, it is necessary to identify what the basic geometric objective is (the applications geometric requirement) and then to understand the implications of errors in the determination of position. Errors will occur, and the accuracy of any positioning system is primarily defined by the radius  of an error circle, inside which an estimate position will fall with a specified probability, or relative frequency. Only with this understanding is it possible to systematically state an error radius and a confidence, and these are the only meaningful and testable specifications that can be applied to a practical position estimation system.   POSITIONING BASED APPLICATIONS Typical safety related applications fall into four general classes:   Signage: These applications simply provide an in-vehicle instance of a typical road sign. The specific hazard or road attribute being described may or may not actually be present. For example, a ?Deer Crossing? sign only informs the driver to be wary for deer in the roadway. It does not actually tell the driver that deer are present.   Alerts: These applications are closely related to Signage in that they relate to typical road hazards, however they are triggered by the actual presence of the hazard. For example a bridge that has ice detectors may be support an alert that informs approaching vehicles that the bridge is actually icy, whereas the related signage application would only be able to tell the vehicles that the bridge may be icy.  The decision site for signage and alert applications (the location where the sign/alert must be presented) is typically based on vehicle speed and possibly lane of travel. With the distance for presentation of the sign/alert being based on the MUTCD sight distance goals using the vehicle?s actual speed.   Warnings: These applications typically involve a comparison of vehicle position and position related parameters to a safe operating threshold, and if the threshold is crossed, then the warning is activated. For example a stop sign warning application might evaluate the vehicle position, velocity and acceleration. The decision site would be located at the point on the road where the vehicle must begin braking at a pre-defined deceleration level in order to safely stop before the limit line. Warnings might also include higher order elements as well, for example the same stop sign violation warning application might also tell the driver to brake harder if the level of deceleration is not sufficient to stop the vehicle before the limit line. Warning applications may have significant risk implications (e.g., accident, injury or death), so the position requirements may include high levels of accuracy at high levels of confidence, and may include integrity and availability requirements that are used to notify the user if the system cannot be used, or cannot be trusted.   Control: These applications typically assume control of one or more aspects of the vehicle operation in order to assure safety. Control applications may be continuous, for example a lane keeping function that might be activated by the driver, or they may be event based , for example a brake assist function. The specific requirements for control applications vary widely, but generally they require high levels of accuracy and confidence across a variety of position related parameters including position, heading, velocity, acceleration and yaw. Control applications almost certainly carry availability and integrity requirements, and in most applications would be expected to follow aviation level integrity failure requirements (e.g., 10-7).   DECISION MAKING Decision-making typically implies that one is deciding between two states, for example, is the user inside a specified geographic region (decision site), or outside a specified region? Because real world systems are based on measurements of reality, they are necessarily imperfect, and thus it is possible to make both correct and incorrect decisions. More complex decisions may involve more states (for example deciding which among several alternatives to choose), but these too can typically be broken into smaller binary decisions (?A or B or C? can be represented by ?(A or B) or C?). These are illustrated in Figure 1 below.   Reality  Event Present Event Not Present Event Present True Positive False Positive Perception Event Not Present False Negative True Negative Figure 1 Typical Decision Matrix  For example, in the figure above, the ?event? might be ?The vehicle is within X meters of the hazard?. The ?Perception? is the decision that would result from a measurement of the vehicle position. The ?Reality? is what decision would result from knowing the actual vehicle position. As shown in the figure, if the event is actually present, and the decision about the event based on perception is that it is present, the decision is correct. This is termed a ?true positive? event because the event is present (Positive) and the decision based on perception is correct (True). If the event is not actually present, and the decision based on perception is also that the event is not present, then this decision is correct. This is known as a ?true negative? because the event is not actually present (Negative), and the decision based on perception is correct (True). The two error cases are also shown in the figure. If the event is not actually present, but the decision based on perception is that it is present, the decision is incorrect. This is known as a ?False Positive? because the decision based on perception is that the event is present (Positive), but this decision is incorrect (False). Similarly, if the event is actually present, and the decision based on perception is that it is not present, this decision is incorrect. This is known as a ?False Negative? since the decision is that the event is not present (Negative), and this is incorrect (False).   In the ITS position measurement context, a false positive means that the position measurement indicates that the vehicle is in a position where the application should take positive action (alert, warn, control, etc), when in fact it should not. A false negative means that the position measurement indicates that the vehicle is not in a position where the application should take positive action (alert, warn, control, etc), when in fact it should. Generally, false positives result in false alarms, while false negatives result in danger.   POSITIONING ERRORS Position based decision errors result from actual positions being incorrectly measured. For example, if the vehicle is farther way from a warning point that is measured to be (i.e., the measured position is closer than the vehicle actually is), then the system will warn when there is no reason to do so (a false alarm). Similarly, if the vehicle position is actually closer than the measurement indicates it is, then the system will not warn when it should have.  Position measurement errors arise from two independent mechanisms: Systematic errors and random errors.   ? Systematic errors are caused by measurement biases that result in all measurements being in error in the same way. These might be cause, for example by ionospheric conditions that delay the signals from the GPS satellites, or from an anomaly such as the difference between magnetic north and geodetic north.   ? Random errors result from dynamic corruption to the measurements so that two measurements carried out the same way result in different results. These errors maybe caused by noise or by lower level decision threshold errors, rounding errors, etc.   Systematic errors will always result in the decision coming out the same as long as the reality is unchanged. Random errors will generally result in the decision coming out differently between repeated measurements even when the reality is unchanged.   Systematic errors can generally be found and corrected for, and subsequent corrected measurements will all be correct. Random errors cannot be corrected for, and thus represent a more challenging problem for positioning systems.   Random positioning measurement errors can be represented by a probability that the measured position is within some distance of the real position. This is often referred to as a confidence interval, and designated by the term Circular Error Probable (CEP). A typical position measuring system might, for example, be specified as having an accuracy of 1 meter at a 95% CEP, which means that 95% of the measurements of a given position will fall within 1 meter of the actual position. This also implies that 5% of the measurements will fall outside this radius, and do so at any level of error. If the system is designed to tolerate a given error at a given confidence interval, those points that fall outside that radius will cause false positive and false negative decision errors. The degree to which the application must avoid these errors thus determines the degree of confidence required for the measurement, while the ability for the application to tolerate some level of error and still function effectively will determine the radius of the allowable error at that confidence level.   In most ITS situations the result of acting on a false negative decision is dangerous, while the impact of acting on a false positive is a nuisance. Danger and nuisance carry substantially different consequences, so it is reasonable to assume that the confidence interval required to avoid false negatives is substantially higher that that required to avoid false positives. However, in a real measurement system, there is no way to separate these. The occurrence of false positives is a direct consequence of the requirement to avoid false negatives, and, in rare cases the occurrence of false negatives is a direct consequence of the requirement to avoid false positives. This is illustrated in the following paragraphs.   POSITION ESTIMATION Position is generally determined relative to some specific point on the vehicle. For a GPS system, for example, the position reported by the GPS receiver is the position of the GPS antenna.  The position error is thus defined to first order by a circle centered on the GPS antenna as shown in Figure 2 below. This figure shows a typical position measurement error radius at a given confidence level. A typical Rayleigh distribution has been superimposed on the vehicle to illustrate the distribution of positioning measurements relative to the measurement reference point, which in this case has been set to the front of the vehicle. The role of the positioning system is thus to make a positioning decision when the threatened perimeter of the vehicle reaches the decision site, and this decision must be made with some defined level of confidence.     Figure 2 Typical Position Measurement Distribution  Obviously, the measurement point on the vehicle may be different from the point on the vehicle for which position is required. For example, the position of a GPS receiver is the position of the antenna; if the position of the front of the vehicle is critical to the application, the system must know the dimensions of the vehicle in order to translate the measured position to the critical part of the vehicle.    Figure 3 below, illustrates the parameters that describe the position measurement distribution. In this case the distribution is defined by the radius of the confidence interval RCV, and the actual level of confidence that the interval relates to. The meaning of the confidence interval is that statistically C% of the measurements will fall within a distance RCV of the actual position (which is assumed to lie at the mean value of the position).   Since, under many (most) measurement situations the positioning system is only able to provide a single measurement, there is no way to determine where in the distribution shown in Figure 3 the measured value actually lies. In fact the question of what this single measurement actually means is somewhat difficult to answer.    Figure 3 Confidence Interval In Relation to Distribution Radius  Figure 4 shows one way to visualize the meaning of a single measurement made from a system with a known error distribution.    Figure 4 Real Versus Measured Positions  What this figure shows is that the while the real position is only RCV away from the measured position, the perceived actual position may be ?RCV in any direction from the measure position. This means that the system must assume that any position within RCV of the measured position could be the actual position, and then assume the worst case. This worst case may be exactly correct, or it could be as much as 2 RCV away from the actual position, and, as shown in Figure 5 below, well outside the confidence region for the receiver.   Figure 5 Confidence of Measured Position Versus Actual Position  DEVELOPMENT OF POSITIONING REQUIREMENTS  To develop positioning requirements for an application requires identifying the decision site, and determining the maximum acceptable incidence of false positioning decisions for that site relative to the perimeter of the vehicle.  Figure 6 below illustrates the false positive and false negative decisions that can arise from position measurement errors. Here the actual vehicle position is, as above, located at the mean value of the positioning measurement distribution. In some cases the measured value of the position will be ahead of the actual position. In this case the system will decide that the vehicle has reached the decision site when it is actually some distance behind it. This is known as the false positive case (because the system gives a positive indication that the decision site has been reached, but the vehicle is not actually at that position). In other cases the measured value of the position will be behind the actual position. In this case the system will decide that the vehicle has not reached the decision site when it is actually at the decision point. This is known as the false negative case (because the system gives a negative indication that the decision site has been reached, but the vehicle is actually at the decision site). In practice, if one were to use a position measurement system of this type, the system would decide that the decision point had been reached 50% of the time, and decide that it had not been reached 50% of the time, regardless of the confidence of the measurements.   Interestingly, the system would almost never decide that the decision point had been reached (the true positive case) because this would only occur when the actual position of the vehicle was at the decision point, and the measured position was at this same exact point.    Figure 6 Relation of Measurement Distribution to Decision Errors  In order to support a useful decision process, it is necessary to define a true positive region that can actually be supported by position measurements. This region will, of course, include errors, since the only non-erroneous point is the mean value, and this will be measured only with very low frequency. The key to defining the true positive region is thus to allow errors that can be tolerated by the application, and to define a frequency of occurrence for those errors that is acceptable to the user.   The true positive region can be defined by specifying maximum error distance that can be tolerated, and a confidence level that describes the probability that a measured position will be within the error radius from the actual position. These parameters are designated RCV (for radius of the vehicle position at confidence C), and C the required confidence level. This is illustrated in Figure C-8 below. Here we can see that with a probability of C the measured error will be within the confidence interval, and it will be generally either a tolerable false positive, or a tolerable false negative error. If the vehicle is approaching a decision site, and the measured position is more than RCV from the actual vehicle position in the direction of the decision site, the system will decide that the vehicle is at the decision site (an intolerable false positive decision). If the vehicle is approaching a decision site, and the measured position is more than RCV from the actual vehicle position in the direction away from the decision site, the system will decide that the vehicle is not at the decision site (an intolerable false negative decision).   Figure 7 Confidence Interval Radius in Relation to Decision States  Using this approach, the system will, on average, cause the application to act when the vehicle is at the decision site, and will produce false positive and false negative decision errors with the probability defined by the confidence interval C (note that the probability of tolerable a false positive error is C/2, as is the probability of a tolerable false negative error). These errors will be observed by the application taking action either >RCV too early or >RCV too late.   For example an application might seek to stop a vehicle at the stop sign limit line by applying the brakes at a specific distance from the limit line based on the speed of the vehicle. In this case the specific point where the brakes should be applied is the decision site. If the measured position is at the false positive threshold, the vehicle will stop RCV meters short of the limit line. If the measured position is at the false negative threshold, the vehicle will stop RCV meters beyond the limit line. Obviously these situations will occur with probability 1-C, and on average, the vehicle will stop at the limit line.  In this situation, the requirements developer must decide how far from or beyond the limit line is an acceptable place to stop, and how frequently this situation can be tolerated (i.e. he must decide what values of RCV and C are acceptable). Using the above example, the developer might decide that it is acceptable for the vehicle to stop within one meter of the limit line (one meter in either direction) 95% of the time. This corresponds to a accuracy of  RCV= 1 meter with a confidence of 95%. The vehicle will stop 1 meter away from the limit line (too short, or too far) 5% (1-.95) of the time (implying it will stop more than 1 meter into the intersection 2.5% of the time.   There are other ways to approach these error situations, however.   Obviously, false negative decisions represent a dangerous situation. For example a decision site might represent the point at which the vehicle must brake in order to come to a stop before an obstacle. If the measured position implies that the vehicle is farther away from this point than it is, then the decision will be made too late, and the vehicle will be unable to stop in time. False positive decisions represent a nuisance situation that grows greater the farther from the actual position the error is made. A false positive that warns a driver a few meters too early may not even be noticed.   As a result it is possible for the requirements developer to simply decide how to position the true positive relative to the vehicle and the decision point. The designer could also choose to allow some level of false negative decisions to be considered true positive, but this is risky since false negatives may result in collisions and/or injury.  A low risk solution to this problem is shown in Figure 8 below. Here the designer has chosen to define the true positive region as being between zero and two confidence intervals from the vehicle. In order to avoid any false negative decisions within higher than probability C/2, the assumed position of the vehicle perimeter (the front in this figure) is moved from the mean to the false negative threshold of the confidence interval. This shifts the entire false negative region into the region outside the specified confidence interval, so the risk associated with a false negative position decision is determined by the confidence interval (1-C)/2; that is, all false negative errors are considered intolerable. If the risk associated with a given interval is too high, then the requirement on the confidence interval can simply be increased to the point where the probability that the risk will be realized (i.e. the probability of a false negative decision) risk is acceptable. By choosing this arrangement, the system will produce false negative decision errors with probability  (1-C)/2, and the defined true positive region will only contain the less risky false positive errors; The price paid for this improvement is that the region over which tolerable false positive decision errors will be observed is twice as large as the earlier arrangement.    Figure 8 Alternative Definition of True Positive Region to Avoid False Negatives Occurring With Probability Greater Than (1-C)/2  So, in this situation the stop sign stopping example described above will stop the vehicle on average RCV away from the limit line, and will stop the vehicle with probability C in a region between zero and 2RCV away from the limit line. The vehicle will stop over the limit line with probability 1-C.   Some examples maybe useful to illustrate the impact of this approach as a requirements specification tool:   Case A: Automatic Stop Sign Braking This application specifies the decision point to be the position from the stop sign limit line from which the vehicle can brake to a stop at the limit line, with no more deceleration than, for example 0.5 G.   The false negative decision would thus require more than 0.5 G braking deceleration, and the false positive situation would stop the vehicle too far from the limit line. Using Figure 5-7 above, we can specify, for example, that we are not willing to have a false negative (stopping over the line) occur more often than 1 in 104 events. This requires a confidence interval of 99.99%. In addition, the application developer might decide that in the extreme false positive case the vehicle will stop 2RCV meters from the limit line (while the positioning system will think it is stopping it exactly at the limit line). The designer can then decide how far is too far to be acceptable. For example, they might decide that 2 meters is as far from the line that they are willing to have the car stop, with 99.99% confidence. This logic fixes the required positioning accuracy at: RCV=1 Meter at 99.99% confidence. Using the formula for RMS error above, this corresponds to a required RMS error of 0.55 meters, or a CEP 50% of about 0..49 meters, in the direction of travel.   Case B: Stop Sign Violation Warning This application specifies the decision point to be the position from the stop sign limit line that is 2.4 seconds away at the vehicle speed of travel.  The nominal speed of travel is 50 kph, or 13.9 meters/second. Stopping from 50 kph in 2.4 seconds requires a braking level of 0.59 G.   Since most drivers begin braking, on average, at 2.5 seconds from the limit line, the designer decides that warning more than 2.5 seconds away from the limit line will be a nuisance. As a result, the difference between the false negative threshold and the false positive threshold is 0.1 seconds. At the nominal 50 kph, this corresponds to a distance of 1.35 meters. The designer further decides that, since the false positive is not a safety concern, he is willing to tolerate a nuisance warning once every 100 events. This corresponds to a confidence interval of radius 1.35/2=.675 with a confidence of 99%. The tolerable RMS error is thus 0.52 meters, or a 50% CEP of 0.47 meters. Obviously, if the designer is willing to accept slightly higher deceleration levels in the warning case, he could relax this requirement substantially. For example, if the warning case assumes braking of 0.79 G for the warning situation (i.e. emergency braking), then the  vehicle will stop in 1.79 seconds, and the difference between the false positive and false negative time interval is 0.61 seconds. 0.61 seconds at 50 kph corresponds to a distance of 8.4 meters. Using the same confidence level as above, this corresponds to a confidence interval of radius 8.4/2=4.2 meters with a confidence of 99%. The tolerable RMS error is thus 3.26 meters, or a 50% CEP of 2.9 meters. Obviously the positioning accuracy requirement is a very sensitive function of tolerable deceleration level.   In summary, positioning requirements can be easily derived using the following process:   Determine if false negatives are tolerable within the specified confidence interval and error distance RCV. If so, then the system will overshoot the decision site between zero and RCV meters C/2 % of the time, undershoot it between zero and RCV meters C/2 % of the time, and on average will estimate it correctly. It will overshoot it by more than RCV (1-C)/2% of the time, and undershoot it by more than RCV (1-C)/2% of the time.  The value of RCV will be determined by how far short of or past the decision site the application can act without danger or nuisance, with probability (1-C)/2 for each of those situations.  The specifics of the application will impact both the acceptable error distance RCV and the confidence value C.   If false negatives cannot be tolerated between zero and RCV, then the acceptable false positive distance will be 2RCV. In this situation the system will overshoot the decision site some non-zero distance only (1-C)/2 % of the time (the true false negative decision), undershoot it between zero and 2RCV meters C % of the time, and on average will undershoot it by RCV meters. It will overshoot it by more than 2RCV meters (1-C)/2 % of the time (the defined false positive decision).   The value of RCV will be determined by how far short of the decision site the application can act without nuisance, with probability (1-C)/2 for that situation.  The specifics of the application will impact both the acceptable error distance RCV and the confidence value C.   Developing confidence requirements requires understanding the implications of making a false positive or false negative application error. The generally accepted approach for defining safety level requirements is the Safety Integrity Level or SIL.  SILs are measures of the safety risk of a given process, and essentially define to what extent can a process be expected to perform safely? And, in the event of a failure, to what extent can the process be expected to fail safely?   Under the SIL approach, safety is stratified into four discrete levels. Each level represents an order of magnitude of risk reduction. The higher the SIL level, the greater the impact of a failure and the lower the failure rate that is acceptable. The table below illustrates the relationship between SIL level and failure rates.   Safety Integrity Levels and Related Probability of Failures Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Low Demand Mode Of Operation (Average Probability of failure to perform it?s design Continuous/High Demand Mode Of Operation (Probability of dangerous failure per hour) function on demand) 4 >= 10 E-5 to 10 E-4 >= 10 E-9 to 10 E-8 3 >= 10 E-4 to 10 E-3 >= 10 E-8 to 10 E-7 2 >= 10 E-3 to 10 E-2 >= 10 E-7 to 10 E-6 1 >= 10 E-2 to 10 E-1 >= 10 E-6 to 10 E-5 Determining the SIL for an application, or a system that implements an application is complex and requires an extensive analysis. The figure below illustrates a risk graph that is the basis for determination of the required SIL.   Typical Risk Graph (Methods of Determining Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Requirements - Pros and Cons by W G Gulland;  April 2004)  The parameters for this graph are provided in the below  Consequence CA Minor Injury CB 0.01 to 0.1 Probable Fatalities per Event CC >0.1 to 1.0 Probable Fatalities per Event CD >1 Probable Fatalities per Event Exposure FA <10% of Time FB >10% of Time Avoidability PA >90% Probability that Hazard can be Avoided PB < 90% Probability that Hazard can be Avoided Demand Rate W1 <1 in 30 Years W2 1 in >3 to 30 Years W3 I in >0.3 to 3 Years  For most connected ITS applications, the exposure rate is less than 10% of the time. Applications where this is not the case would be, for example automated driving where the system would be involved in continuous control of the vehicle as it drives along the road. Similarly, for non-automated applications, the avoidability is generally >90%. This is because the driver is assumed to be in control, and the system is simply providing added safety benefits. For automated control applications, such as automatic braking the avoidability would be <90%. In general the demand rate is potentially every time the vehicle is driven, so this value would be typically less than 0.3 years.

Based on these parameters, the process derives positioning requirements in a form that is directly related to the way that positioning estimation devices and systems are specified, specifically the radius of error that the positioning system will experience with a specified relative frequency, or confidence interval.

Interpretation of GPS Positioning Accuracy and Measurement Integrity in a Dynamic Mobile Environment  Scott Andrews Cogenia Partners, LLC   ABSTRACT GPS position measurements are typically described by stating parameters of the statistical distribution of the measurements of a stationary receiver (e.g. 50% CEP). However, in a moving vehicle, typical receivers only produce a single measurement in a measurement interval (typically one second). Conventional practice applies the distribution parameters (error radius and confidence) to these isolated measurements. However, this approach is incorrect since the actual position is not known, and in some instances the confidence interval radius may imply that a position may be within the confidence interval from the measured position when, in fact, it is twice the interval radius away. This paper explores this phenomenon, and provides a correct interpretation of GPS position measurements in a dynamic environment. It also explores the possibility of using the over specification of the position, that results when more than four satellites are in view, to determine not only the current integrity of the position measurement, but also to improve the accuracy of the reported position measurement.  INTRODUCTION GPS receiver positioning accuracy specifications are typically described in terms of an allowable error radius, and a confidence interval. These parameters taken together roughly characterize the distribution of position estimates that would be collected if the receiver were placed at a known position and allowed to accumulate measurements over some time period. Allowing for systematic offsets due primarily to tropospheric effects, this distribution is centered on the actual position, and has an essentially Gaussian characteristic. GPS technology provides for several different ways to characterize this distribution, but all of these effectively characterize the probability that a given measurement will fall within a specified radius of the actual position.   For effectively all automotive applications, the GPS receiver is in motion, and, as a result, the reported position is only a single sample of the distribution that would be observed were the vehicle stationary at the specific position it is in when the GPS signals arrive at the GPS antenna. This observation raises questions about how to properly interpret the single measured position value one obtains during each measurement interval from a GPS receiver in motion. This paper focuses primarily on this issue.  The GPS solution requires pseudo-ranges from four satellites. These four values are used in the GPS system of equations to determine the time that the signals arrived at the receiver antenna, and the latitude, longitude ad altitude of the receiver antenna at that time. Since the satellite constellation changes all the time, and since other error contributors may vary, it is useful, especially in safety of life situations to understand the integrity of the position estimate. In addition, since under most conditions the GPS receiver is tracking a substantial number of satellites, it is possible to determine multiple GPS fixes for a single measurement interval, and thereby better understand the instantaneous distribution of measurements taken at that specific position. This is typically done in aviation systems, but currently, most low cost automotive applications ignore this additional information. As safety applications become more widespread, this situation is likely to change.   POSITION ACCURACY SPECIFICATION  Independent GPS measurements taken at the same position will, as a result of the various random error mechanisms, result in a distribution of estimated positions. This distribution can be approximated by a bivariate Gaussian distribution assuming no correlation between the variables. In most situations this is further simplified to assume that the latitude and longitude variables have the same variance (not strictly true in all situations). With this assumption, the errors can be modeled using a simple Rayleigh distribution.   EQ 1: Probability(Error ¡Ü 2RCV)=1-e-(2RCV/RMS-Error)2  The Rayleigh distribution allows comparison of several confidence intervals. The table below illustrates the numerical relationship between seven common confidence intervals used to specify positioning accuracy, and this allows conversion from one measure to another. For example a measure quoted as RMS 95% of 1 meter, is the same as a CEP 50% interval with diameter of 0.6 meters. A system that achieves a CEP 50% of 1 meter, is the same as a system that achieves a 2.08 meter CEP at 95% confidence.    Relationships Between Typical Raleigh Confidence Metrics   Here the ?mean? error implies the average (or mean) deviation from the actual position (the one sigma error), ?RMS? implies the root mean square of the deviations from the actual position, CEP (Circular Error Probable) 50% implies the median error wherein 50% of the measurements lie inside a circle of the given CEP diameter, and Horiz. 95% implies a circle with the stated diameter within which 95% of the measurements fall.    Position is generally determined relative to some specific point on the vehicle. For a GPS system, for example, the position reported by the GPS receiver is the position of the GPS antenna.  The position error is thus defined to first order by a circle centered on the GPS antenna as shown in Figure 1 below. This figure shows a typical position measurement error radius at a given confidence level. A typical Rayleigh distribution has been superimposed on the vehicle to illustrate the distribution of positioning measurements relative to the measurement reference point, which in this case has been set to the front of the vehicle (normally this would be, for example the back edge of the vehicle roof).     Figure 1 Typical Position Measurement Distribution  So, specification of the radius of the distribution, and the confidence required, effectively defines the distribution of tolerable measurement errors.  POSITION MEASUREMENT INTEGRITY Integrity is determined by assessing the confidence level of the measured position relative to a confidence threshold or integrity limit. If the measured confidence is above the threshold, then the measurement is said to have integrity, and if the measurement is below the threshold it is said to not have integrity.   Determining the confidence level of a measured position requires some means for cross-checking the measurement. This is typically done by measuring the position using multiple means, and then examining the distribution of those measurements. Figure 2 below illustrates a required minimum integrity together with the distributions from two measurement sets A and B.   In this example, the integrity limit has been set to a 90% confidence level, which means that 90% of the measured points must fall within the physical range shown on the diagram (although there is no reason that the integrity limit could not be set to some other value). The plot for Measurement Set A, which has a standard deviation of  0.4 relative to the requirement shows that the 90% confidence radius is well inside the required limit (red plot). In contrast, Measurement Set B has a standard deviation three times the requirement, and the corresponding 90% confidence points are well outside the limit.   Integrity is thus a measure of how much the measurement is to be trusted independently from the published performance specifications. When users are expecting to trust their lives to the measurements, it is wise to double check that the system is performing as expected. In many implementations, integrity is simply compared to a limit value, and if the integrity falls below the limit, then the system is not allowed to function (because the measurement cannot be trusted sufficiently to allow the system to operate). In other systems, the integrity value may be used to discount the effect of the measurement or to inform the user to use the measured results with caution.    Figure 2 Positioning Integrity Examples Measurement of Integrity Assessing integrity requires a set of measurements in order to estimate the distribution of the measurements; this distribution is then compared to the integrity limit to determine if the results can be used. This requirement means that some positioning systems are not suitable for applications requiring integrity. Specifically, systems that only produce a 0 ?0.1 ?0.2 ?0.3 ?0.4 ?0.5 ?0.6 ?0.7 ?0.8 ?0.9 ?99 ? 99 ?single independent measurement cannot be used for this purpose because they do not provide a sufficiently large measurement sample set to determine the statistics of the distribution. However, many positioning systems do allow for multiple independent measurements. For example, two bearing measurements made from an unknown location to two independent landmarks of known position can be used to determine position on a map. If three landmarks are used then there are three separate position fixes, and these can then be compared to determine the (rough) distribution, and this will provide the confidence level necessary to assess the integrity of the measurement. GPS provides especially useful integrity data. GPS uses a system of pseudo-ranges determined from synchronized satellite signals. The pseudo-ranges from four satellites are used to solve the four variable time and position equation (x, y, z and time). If pseudo-ranges from five satellites are used, then the system of four equations is ?over specified?. In this case there are five possible sets of four satellites, and each set can be used to compute a position fix. Under many situations a GPS receiver may have as many as 12 pseudo ranges, which corresponds to 495 separate position measurements, of which 3 are fully independent, 4 share at least one satellite with another solutions, and 15 share at least two satellites. The balance might be used, but the results will not be particularly representative of the actual distribution of errors since the measurements are not particularly independent.  Not all of these combinations represent useful constellations from a measurement geometry (e.g. dilution of precision) perspective, so, in practice, integrity is derived from a small subset of the available possible solutions.   A variety of algorithms [2, 3, 4, 5] have been developed to assess the distribution of these multiple redundant measurements. The reason for this is because the distributions are not strictly Gaussian, and, at the integrity limits required by safety of life applications (typically six sigma), the slight non-Gaussian nature of the distributions corrupts the computational results, and produces either overly pessimistic results (if, for example ?poor satellite constellations are included in the distribution), or overly optimistic results (if, for example, the measurement sample is too small).   In addition to simply reporting the outcome of the comparison between the measured distribution and the integrity limit threshold (the ?yes/no? integrity limit report), it is also possible to actually report the estimated position error, or to determine an improved best fit position and associated confidence level. This may be useful for applications that are able to provide limited capability at reduced levels of accuracy.   INTERPRETATION OF GPS MEASUREMENTS A GPS solution represents the position in three dimensions of the GPS receiver antenna at the time value provided with the position fix. Under static situations, each GPS measurement interval generates a new estimate for the fixed position, and over time, these measurements should collectively conform to the published accuracy distribution for the receiver. Under normal ITS operating situations, however, the vehicle is typically moving, so the receiver only generates one position estimate at each position. At 100 kph, and with one second GPS measurement intervals, sequential position estimates will be about 28 meters apart, and represent the position of the vehicle at very different locations.   Unfortunately, this phenomenon complicates the interpretation of these measurements in terms of the published accuracy of the receiver. Figure 3 illustrates a typical single position measurement. It is important to note that in this situation only the measured position is known, and there is no way to estimate, from this single measurement, where the reported measured position might lie relative to the actual position. What one can say is that, assuming nominal receiver operation with an error radius of RCV at confidence C, the measured position will lie within RCV of the actual position with probability C. Figure 3 Typical GPS Position Report  However, since the actual position is not known, and the only value we have is the reported position, we do not know where the actual position lies relative to the reported position. Figure 4 illustrates this problem.    Figure 4 Ambiguity About Actual Position Relative to Reported GPS Position  There is a common misconception that one can simply scribe the error radius RCV around the measured position, and that the actual position will then lie within this circle with probability C, as shown in Figure 5. However, this is incorrect.    Figure 5 Incorrect Interpretation Of Reported GPS Position  The erroneous nature of this assumption is illustrated in Figure 6 below. Here, the points in green are actually within the 90% CEP circle for the receiver, while the points in red are within the same 90% radius of the reported point, but are outside the receiver 90% circle.    Figure 6 Interpretation of Reported GPS Position  If the incorrect interpretation of the position report as shown in Figure 5 is used, the system will make decision errors. The type of decision error depends on which direction the vehicle is traveling, and which direction the actual position lies relative to the reported position. These errors are illustrated in Figures 7 and 8 below. In Figure 7, the actual position lies between the reported position and the decision point. Here the decision point is the location where the system must decide to act or not in order to carry out its objective function (i.e. warn, brake, steer, etc). As shown in the figure, if the objective of the system is to act when the actual position is within R of the decision point, the system will fail to act at this point. Only when the actual position is at the decision point will the system act, but this is too close. This Type II decision error is known as a false negative, or a missed detection since the system failed to act when it should have.   Figure 7 Missed Detection (False Negative) Situation  Figure 8 illustrates the opposite situation where the reported position is between the actual position and the decision point.   Here, the system will warn when the reported position is R away from the decision point, but in this case the actual position is 2R away. This Type I error is called a false positive, or a false alarm since the system is taking action when it should not.     Figure 8 False Alarm (False Positive) Situation  To avoid these errors, one must either reinterpret the relationship between the GPS receiver accuracy and the application or system requirement, or the position distribution must be measured.   Conservative Interpretation of GPS Measurement A conservative, but safe reinterpretation of the GPS measurement relative to the accuracy specification is illustrated in Figure 9 below.   Here the system/application requirement is to act when the actual position is within R of the decision point. In order to assure this performance with 90% (in this case) confidence, the receiver accuracy at 90% confidence must have a radius of R/2. This approach implies that the receiver must provide twice the accuracy required by the system/application.    Figure 9 Accuracy Required to Assure Correct Decision Making With Required Confidence  Error Distribution Estimation A more accurate approach to interpreting GPS measurements is to estimate the distribution of error based on as many reasonable GPS solutions as can be obtained from the currently available set of satellites. One approach to this it to compute all possible solutions from all combinations of satellites. However, this approach is time consuming, and will result in a non Gaussian distribution. The reason for this is that the full set of possible solutions will include obviously poor satellite constellations, so the population of high error solutions will be unusually large, and using all possible solutions means that many of the solutions are not actually independent of each other.  In a situation with 12 available satellites, there are 495 possible combinations of five satellites. Only three of these are fully independent solutions (solutions that do not use any of the same satellites). Five solutions share only one satellite in common, and 15 that share two. The balance share three satellites. The fewer shared satellites the more independent the measurements.   An alternative approach is to determine the dilution of precision for all satellite combinations, and use this to screen out obviously inferior constellations, then, from the selected set of low DOP (higher quality) constellations, select the set that has the highest number of independent solutions, or partially independent solutions, and compute the GPS position estimates for these sets. This provides an approximation of the error distribution for the receiver at that particular position and time. There are several methods for then determining the best estimate position. For example, [7] describes determining the position that represents the least square error for the computed distribution.   The advantage of this approach is that it provides a better estimate of the actual position rather than simply reporting a single position. This avoids the overly constrained conservative approach described earlier, and allows the required accuracy of the receiver to be loosened to approximately the accuracy required by the application. It also provides a measure of the integrity of the solutions which can be used to assess the ability of the system to support applications involving safety of life.   CONCLUSION When in motion, conventional GPS receivers are only able to provide a single sample of the distribution that is the basis for their performance specification. This implies that the accuracy required to meet the needs of a particular application may be substantially higher than one might derive based only on the application geometry. An alternative is to derive a set of estimated positions from the over specified set that results when multiple (more than four) satellites are in view. This approach provides an estimate of the distribution of positions, and promises to relieve the accuracy requirement by up to a factor of two. This approach also allows an estimate of the integrity of the solution.

SMART Highway also utilizes all-weather radar to support day-and-night safety driving and suitable traffic flow.  This paper introduces a safety driving information support system developed by South Korea¡¯s SMART Highway project called RVMS (Road-Vehicle situation Management System). We designed and implemented RVMS which consists of the Vehicle Management Terminal System located inside the vehicle and the Road-Vehicle Information Management Server System which is a roadside local server. Our goal is to provide real-time safety driving information to the driver by simultaneously analysing the vehicle and road conditions. RVMS detects road surface conditions through 2 radar and reports it as ¡°wet,¡± ¡°ice,¡± ¡°snow,¡± ¡°obstacle¡± and ¡®normal.¡± Vehicle information (speed, RPM, DTC-code, battery voltage, coolant temperature, etc.) is collected through a device that is connected to an OBD-II (On Board Diagnostics) interface. RVMS also includes road situation information, vehicle status and total information service guides. In the future, this system will be used as an accident prevention and smooth traffic flow lead system. INTRODUCTION A driver¡¯s cognitive skills decrease during high speed driving and may subsequently cause a traffic accident. As such, it is necessary to develop a system that provides the driver safety driving information that combines the status of the vehicle as well as road surface conditions.  Recently, technology for real-time vehicle monitoring (speed, RPM, DTC-code, battery voltage, coolant temperature, etc.) has been developed using an OBD-II interface connected to the ECU (Engine Control Unit) [1][2]. In addition, South Korea¡¯s SMART Highway project developed a radar detector that senses road conditions and reports ¡°dry,¡± ¡°wet,¡± ¡°ice,¡± and ¡°obstacle¡± to the driver[4][5]. In this paper, we propose a safety driving information support system called RVMS (Road-Vehicle situation Management System). This technology provides the driver with real-time vehicle status as well as road surface conditions. ALL-WEATHER ROAD-VEHICLE SITUATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The driver's situational awareness significantly degrades in high-speed driving conditions and increases the probability of a major traffic accident. Therefore, a safety driving support system that can warn a driver of dangerous road conditions such as ice, obstacles and troubled vehicles ahead is needed. We developed an all-weather road-vehicle situation management system prototype that provides a safe driving information service which combines road conditions and vehicle status information (Fig. 1) through the SMART Highway PROJECT[3].  The RD (road-surface data Radar Detector), CBS (Communication Base Station) and LS (smart road side Local Server) are established at regular intervals in the SMART highways. The RD and CBS are connected to the LS by wire. The RD detects road conditions such as ice, water and obstacles and transfers the information to the LS. The LS saves the road status information and determines danger levels by analyzing road status, then informs the risk to the vehicle in real time. The vehicle receives the information and analyzes the road ahead. Road situation information is then displayed to the driver on the terminal located in the dashboard.  3  Fig. 1. Road-Vehicle Situation Management Service  The OBD-II based information collection equipment and the terminal are located inside the vehicle. Vehicle status information such as speed, battery voltage, coolant temperature and vehicle trouble is collected and stored. Driver assistance information is then analyzed.  We use an OBU/RSE communication device based on WAVE, developed at ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), to communicate between V2I(Vehicle to road Infrastructure) and V2V(Vehicle to Vehicle) [6].   Fig. 2. The Components of Vehicle-Road situation Management System THE FUNCTION OF VEHICLE MANAGEMENT  TERMINAL SYSTEM  Fig. 3 shows the components of the VMT(Vehicle Management Terminal system). The VMT consists of a COMM(COMMunication system), VIM(Vehicle Information Management system), RVSD(Road-Vehicle integrated Situation Decision system) and GUI (Graphic User Interface). 4  Fig. 3. Vehicle Management Terminal System  The COMM system defines the specifications of the interface and connects the in-vehicle OBD-II based information collection equipment, GPS and WAVE equipment then sends and receives information.  The VMT is connected to the GPS which receives location information. The OBD-II equipment receives vehicle information such as speed, battery voltage, coolant temperature and vehicle trouble information.  The VIM system manages vehicle status information, driving history information, dangerous situation history information and vehicle trouble history information. The vehicle status information consists of speed, battery voltage, coolant temperature, etc. The driving history information consists of driving time, mileage, GPS coordinates from the starting position, GPS coordinates of the end position, sudden acceleration times, sudden deceleration times and fuel consumption. The dangerous situation history information consists of date and dangerous situation information. The vehicle trouble history information consists of date and DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) information.  The RVSD system performs an integrated situation decision if it needs to alert the driver utilizing the danger status of the vehicle, emergency alerts of surrounding vehicles and road conditions.  The GUI system¡¯s screen continuously processes and displays the menu, pop-up and input screens. The display continuously displays the surface conditions of the road ahead, driving time after vehicle start-up, mileage, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The menu screen reports information to the driver when the driver reduces speed and stops the vehicle. The menu screen consists of driving history information, vehicle trouble history information, consumption management, vehicle information settings, communication status management and help information. The pop-up screen will display when notifications are needed to alert the driver of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) danger, road risks and vehicle trouble. The input screen manages the driver and vehicle ID as well as the amount and dates of fuel injection. 5 ROAD-VEHICLE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT    SERVER SYSTEM Fig. 4 shows the components of the RVS (Road-Vehicle information management Server system). RVS consists of the VIP(Vehicle Information processing System), RIP(Road Information Processing system), TCC(Terminal Connection Communication system) and RIC(Radar Information Connection system).  The VIP stores vehicle status and trouble information collected from the VMT which is driven on the SMART highway and analyzes surrounding troubled vehicles at regular intervals on the local server. The VIP system performs statistical processing on average speed, hourly RPMs or for each vehicle and determines the vehicle information collection cycle for traffic conditions. If there are many vehicles driving around the local server, the collection period of information, such as speed and RPMs, increases. If a small number of vehicles drive around the local server, the collection period of information is the basic collection time so that unnecessary information collection is minimized.  The RIP system stores road status information to the database and analyzes the road conditions by location. The RIP system analyzes dangerous situations associated with road conditions and vehicle information then saves the information. In addition, it can store the road¡¯s topography such as location information of the local server area, lane number, gradient and width. The TCC system manages the V2I interface status to communicate terminal-server information and send/receive according to a predefined protocol.  The RIC system processes the location information of the radar, road status data and road hazard information.   Fig. 4. The Component of Road-Vehicle Information Management Server System THE PROTOCOL BETWEEN TERMINAL AND SERVER. Fig. 5 shows the protocol between terminal and server. The VMT sends vehicle information 6 such as car ID, cycle, collection time, latitude, longitude, speed, RPM, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, battery status and DTC information to the RVS periodically.     Fig. 5.  The Protocol between Terminal and Server The RVS sends road surface, problem vehicle, advisory speed and abnormal speed information. The road surface information consists of event time, server IP address, driving direction, lane information and sensing location (start latitude and longitude, end latitude and  longitude), road status, safe levels, etc. The problem vehicle information consists of event time, server IP address, problem car ID, type, and location (latitude, longitude), etc. The advisory speed information consists of analysis time, server IP address, advisory speed, average section speed, etc. The abnormal speed car information consists of event time, server IP address, car ID and speed, abnormal car location (latitude, longitude), etc. VEHICLE MANAGEMENT TERMINAL SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION The Vehicle Management Terminal System (VMT) is implemented with a continuous screen display of the driver operated menu and pop-up screens when safety alerts are neccessary.    Always Showing Screen Implementation Fig. 6 shows the Vehicle Management Terminal system¡¯s screen. The upper-left hand corner of the screen shows video of the road ahead which is captured with a web camera. The upper-right hand corner of the screen reports the advisory speed and the conditions of the road ahead. The bottom of the screen displays necessary information to the driver: mileage after 7 starting, driving time, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.    Fig. 6. Constant Screen of the Terminal System  Menu Screen Implementation Fig. 7 shows the menu screen of the Vehicle Management Terminal system. The click-through menu screen is operated by the driver. The driver history information and vehicle diagnostic history information check, fuel and communication state management and vehicle information set up functions are provided to the driver for a convenient driving environment.       Fig. 7. The MENU Screen of the Terminal System   8 Pop-Up Screen Implementation The pop-up screen is displayed when a general situation alert is needed to alert the driver by analyzing vehicle and road condition.  The risk information guide informs the driver of sudden deceleration of the vehicle ahead, risky road conditions such as ice, rain and obstacles, driving patterns and abnormal conditions around the vehicle speed and vehicle failure.  CASE 1.  Front Vehicle to Vehicle Alarm Information Fig. 8 shows vehicle to vehicle(V2V) pop-up alarm screen. If a driver suddenly decelerates the vehicle, the VMT broadcasts this information to the surrounding vehicles on the SMART highway. After receiving the sudden deceleration warning coming from another vehicle, the surrounding vehicles are analyzed by the GPS which uses the data to confirm that all vehicles are driving in the same direction. If the vehicle which suddenly decelerated is located in front of a vehicle and the deceleration ratio is greater than the set threshold, then the VMT displays the pop-up warning screen.     Fig. 8. Vehicle to Vehicle POP-UP ALARM Screen  When a driver activates an emergency button, the vehicle broadcasts the status to the surrounding vehicles. The vehicle that receives the emergency alert sends a warning to the driver if the emergency vehicle is in front.      CASE 2. Troubled Vehicle Alarm Information  Fig. 9 shows the troubled vehicle POP-UP alarm screen. If the VMT perceives a vehicle coolant temperature anomaly, abnormal battery voltage, and/or failure information from the in-vehicle OBD-II based information collection equipment, then it analyzes the information using the VMT_DB to determine the danger level of driving conditions. If it is difficult to continue to drive the vehicle, then the VMT displays the troubled vehicle POP-UP alarm screen.  In addition, surrounding vehicles receive information on the location and failure of the emergency vehicle. 9   Fig. 9. Troubled Vehicle POP-UP ALARM Screen   CASE 3. Dangerous Road Status Alarm Fig. 10 shows the dangerous road status alarm screen. If the VMT receives data on unsafe road conditions such as ice, water and/or obstacles from the local server, the GPS warns the driver of the upcoming hazard. If the road conditions ahead are unsafe, the VMT displays the pop-up warning screen to notify the driver.      Fig. 10. Dangerous Road Status Alarm Screen  CASE 4. Dangerous Vehicle Occurred Alarm The left side of Fig. 11 shows a vehicle diagnostic trouble code. The bottom of Fig. 11 indicates a low speed vehicle driving ahead. The RVS can broadcast faulty vehicle information to the surrounding vehicles which are also being monitored. When the vehicle receives this information, it determines if the vehicle is located in front. If a vehicle becomes troubled, the VMT displays a troubled vehicle pop-up warning screen to notify the driver.  10 The RVS analyzes the behavior of the vehicles in the local server monitoring perimeter. If a vehicle has an abnormal driving pattern such as low speeds, sudden stop or deceleration, the RVS sends the information to the VMT. If there is a vehicle in front with abnormal driving patterns, the VMT displays a pop-up warning screen to notify the driver.   CASE 5. Recommendation Speed Warninng The right side of Fig. 11 shows recommended speed alert screen.  The RVS calculates the recommended safe driving speed (85% of the speed during a 5 minute period) for the vehicles in the monitoring area according to the road conditions[7]. The advisory speed is calculated periodically because the road conditions vary at a slower rate. We use a tire-road friction coefficient according to road conditions, driver reaction time (PRT: Perception Response Time), gradient (slope), gravitational acceleration and distance headway (vehicle length + inter-vehicle spacing) when stopping as the calculating parameters.     Fig. 11. Dangerous Vehicle Occurred and Recommendation Speed Alarm Screen  When the VMT receives advisory speed information from RVS, it compare the speed of his vehicle with received safe speed.  If the difference is over the threshold, then VMT display pup-up warning screen to notify advisory speed information to the driver. 11 WAVE DEVICES FOR V2V/V2I COMMUNICATION The RVMS must communicate between the VMT and RVS as well between the VMT and VMT. We use a VMC (Vehicle Multi-hop Communication) device based on WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) technology developed by the ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute)[6]. VMC equipment has the following system specifications.  item feature Vehicle Speed Maximum 200km/h Communication Range Maximum 1 Km Communication Method Unicast, Broadcast Link setup time Less than 100msec Communication type V2V, V2I & I2V RF frequency range 5.835~5.895GHz Data rate Maximum 10Mbps Channel bandwidth 10MHz Modulation OFDM (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM) MAC Protocol EDCA, CSMA/CA  The VMC equipment shown in Fig. 12 consists of a communication device which is connected to the VMT and an external antenna located over the vehicle and roadside base station which makes communication between V2V and V2I possible.     Fig. 12. VMC(Vehicle Multi-hop Communication) Equipment 12 FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we described a safety driving information support system called RVMS (Road-Vehicle situation Management System). It collects road conditions and vehicle driving information, then analyzes the data to provide safety driving information to the driver. Currently, only basic functionality has been implemented in the prototype for testing. In the future, this system will be built and operate on the SMART Highway. Decreased traffic accidents can mitigate social and economic costs by utilizing a system that analyzes upcoming road conditions and danger levels of surrounding vehicles and provides safe driving information to the driver. Through ongoing research on vehicle technology, road surface information and local to central server data transfer across the SMART highway, the development of a total safe driving support system can be achieved.

SMARTPHONE-INTEGRATED CONNECTIVITY APPLICATIONS FOR VEHICULAR AD-HOC NETWORKS   Donald K. Grimm General Motors Research & Development Center 30500 Mound Road, Warren, MI  48090 USA +1 586 298 0251, donald.grimm@gm.com   ABSTRACT The emergence of the smartphone as a powerful mobile computing platform has resulted in the tremendous growth of user services. This paper describes a smartphone-integrated vehicle platform that utilizes vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure/pedestrian (broadly V2X) communication to provide a variety of traveler information and infotainment services. The system and underlying architecture enables a smartphone to host a variety of applications and seamlessly integrate with vehicle services. This approach facilitates the deployment of new services without changes to the vehicle architecture. A variety of applications were developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the system.  INTRODUCTION In 2006, there were more than 250 million vehicles that were registered within the United States (1).  Given a median passenger vehicle age of 9.2 years (2), it will likely require many years before vehicular ad-hoc networks become sufficiently connected to provide drivers with benefits if systems are deployed exclusively by automakers.  One potential solution to this technology deployment challenge is to leverage existing consumer devices.  Smartphones have continued to increase in both popularity and capability, making it feasible that these devices could participate in vehicular ad-hoc networks and host a variety of traveler information and infotainment applications.  According to one survey, 51% of vehicle owners in the U.S. currently have smartphones and 30% have used their devices while driving (3).  The U.S. Department of Transportation under the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) has recently expressed an interest in aftermarket devices that can be used to accelerate fleet penetration of V2X technology (4). The RITA initiative and associated connected vehicle programs were created to extend the range of communication options that were originally envisioned for the Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) program. The initiative includes technologies in addition to Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) such as cellular, Wi-Fi, or satellite communications. Under this initiative, aftermarket devices play a key role to ensure that the benefits of connected vehicle applications can be realized in the near future. Without a mechanism for adding communication capability to an existing vehicle fleet, the deployment of a connected vehicle environment could be substantially delayed.  In 2006, General Motors developed a range of portable devices with a goal of accelerating the deployment of DSRC (5). These devices were known as Transponders, since their use is conceptually similar to devices used by aircraft to avoid collisions. A variety of Transponder designs were constructed with different operating characteristics. An Active Transponder executes applications and provides drivers with visual and audible feedback. Passive Transponders communicate ¡°Here I Am¡± messages that increase the visibility of the carrier to surrounding vehicles. Other types of Transponders can be retrofitted into a vehicle and interface to existing displays or vehicle chimes. Battery powered Transponders were developed that could be carried by pedestrians or cyclists to increase their visibility to motorists (6).  Taken as a whole, previous developments in the area of V2X communications have spanned a range of solutions that include standalone, retrofit and embedded options. The smartphone integration platform extends these solutions by including an option that integrates third party devices in a seamless manner. Whereas the retrofit device can be considered to be a ¡°tightly coupled¡± solution where the add-on device is hard-wired into the vehicle, the smartphone integration platform leverages wireless connectivity capabilities to create a ¡°loosely coupled¡± solution where the customer device is wirelessly networked to the vehicle. This solution reduces the hardware cost burden to the automaker by deploying features onto a customer device. The range of potential deployment options is shown in Figure 1.    Figure 1: Range of Potential V2X Deployment Options  Using this ¡°loosely coupled¡± concept as a basis, a smartphone integration platform was developed that combines the strength of the smartphone device (state-of-the-art processing) with the strengths of the vehicle platform (enhanced antenna, sensing and power capabilities).  SMARTPHONE-VEHICLE INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE Since current smartphones do not have DSRC communication capability (and it is unclear if future devices would have direct access to the V2X network), it is proposed that an embedded vehicle gateway module be used to facilitate V2X communication. The vehicle gateway module provides the smartphone with an extended V2X communication range through the use of a high-mounted vehicle antenna and abundant power resources. Since V2X features are hosted on the smartphone and the gateway is only used enable DSRC communication, this approach enables a lightweight deployment that reduces the impact to vehicle electrical architectures.    A Nexus One smartphone running Android was used as a development platform (other Android devices such as the Motorola DroidX phone and Samsung Galaxy tablet were also used). The StandaloneTransponderEmbeddedSystemLooselyCoupledTightlyCoupledV2X smartphone ¡þapp¡þ wirelessly interfaces to the DSRC gateway to processes the relative locations of remote vehicles and to provide drivers with a variety of information and entertainment features. The multi-threaded application implements a variety of traveler information and infotainment features, a situational awareness algorithm, a graphical user interface and a variety of threads that manage interaction between the smartphone and the Bluetooth devices.    The native Wi-Fi chipset of the smartphone is used to communicate with pedestrians and cyclists (V2P). Communication with pedestrians or cyclists is also possible using DSRC if the pedestrian is carrying a Transponder. The system architecture that describes the potential interactions between vehicles, infrastructure and pedestrians is shown in Figure 2.    Figure 2 ¨C Smartphone Integration Architecture  Bluetooth provides connectivity between the smartphone and other components inside the host vehicle.  The smartphone interfaces to the following types of in-vehicle devices using Bluetooth:  ¡þ DSRC Gateway Module ¨C A DSRC gateway module installed inside the host vehicle is used to communicate system messages to and from remote vehicles. Outgoing messages are communicated from the smartphone to the gateway module over Bluetooth. The messages are then broadcast to remote vehicles using the DSRC radio of the gateway device. Incoming DSRC messages are received by the gateway device and forwarded to the smartphone for decoding and processing. ¡þ CAN Gateway Module ¨C A CAN-to-Bluetooth gateway module is connected to the Onboard Diagnostics Connector (OBD-II) of the vehicle and is used to acquire a variety of vehicle sensor information, such as brake activation status or stability control system status. Location information from the OnStar GPS module is also obtained using this module. The OnStar module was chosen for positioning in place of the smartphone GPS due to the favorable placement of the vehicle antenna.  A rooftop antenna mount results in better satellite visibility and improved location accuracy. ¡þ Tactile Module ¨C A tactile display system installed into the seat pan of the driver seat is used to provide the driver with a notification when a road condition of interest has been GWPhoneGWPhoneV2VV2IV2PVehicle communication supports DSRC or ad-hoc Wi-Fi communicationPortable road side unit for V2I featuresWi-Fi based pedestrian detectiondetected ahead. Tactile displays have been found to be a viable primary component of a driver notification approach, particular from a localization and customer annoyance perspective.  Driver notifications are communicated to the driver using the display of the smartphone.  The system can also communicate notifications to the driver using existing in-vehicle displays such as driver information centers or vehicle chime systems. The in-vehicle displays can be activated via the CAN-to-Bluetooth gateway module.  SMARTPHONE-BASED DRIVER NOTIFICATION FEATURES The V2X smartphone integration platform provides the driver with notifications that originate from communicating objects around the host vehicle. This information may originate from other communicating vehicles, the infrastructure or pedestrians that are located up to 300 meters away. A graphic icon is used to visually indicate the type of notification. Most notifications also have an associate auditory message that describes the nature of the notification (e.g., ¡°Slow Vehicle Ahead¡±). Table 1 provides detail about the specific features that have been implemented on the V2X smartphone integration platform.  Table 1: Smartphone-based Driver Notification Features  Icon Description Activation Criteria  Slow Vehicle Ahead ¡þ Indicates that a vehicle ahead is stopped or traveling much slower than the host vehicle. ¡þ Relative speed > 30 kph ¡þ Hazard lights active  Hard Braking Ahead ¡þ Indicates that a lead vehicle has braked, suddenly. ¡þ Extended brake application ¡þ Deceleration > 0.3g  Slippery Road Ahead ¡þ Indicates stability control system activation.  May indicate a slippery road surface or other type of road hazard. ¡þ Stability control system activation  Rough Road Ahead ¡þ Indicates a pothole ahead of the vehicle. Sensed from wheel speed sensors that detect irregularities in the road surface. ¡þ Rough road indication exceeds user threshold  Pedestrian/Cyclist Ahead ¡þ Provides an indication that there is a pedestrian or cyclist nearby. ¡þ Proximity detection  Sharp Curve Ahead ¡þ Indicates a sharp curve ahead and provides an alert if the vehicle speed exceeds the posted advisory speed.  ¡þ Roadside unit curve ahead message  Stop Sign Notification ¡þ Indicates the presence of a stop sign ahead ¡þ Stop sign location stored in digital map database  Construction Zone Ahead ¡þ Indicates the presence of a construction zone and displays an indication of the vehicle¡¯s progress through the zone. ¡þ Roadside unit construction zone ahead message As a whole, the features listed in Table 1 provide the driver with a detailed view about traffic movements and roadway conditions ahead.  An example driver notification is shown in Figure 3. The notification shown in Figure 3 occurs when a lead vehicle has suddenly performed a hard braking event. In this scenario, the smartphone communicates the traffic event to the vehicle display and an associated auditory message is also played (¡°Hard Braking Ahead¡±).    Figure 3: Hard Braking Vehicle Ahead Scenario  The smartphone application allows the driver to customize the types of notifications that are provided. Using the provided interface, users can enable or disable features according to their preference as well as specify certain application behavior (e.g., what level of road surface roughness is required to activate a rough road ahead notification).  SMARTPHONE-BASED INFOTAINMENT FEATURES In addition to the notification applications described above, V2X communications can enable a variety of infotainment applications. One such class of application enables the exchange of data from one vehicle to another during an encounter on the roadway. An application that exchanges news information or multimedia content would be one example of this type of application.  As part of this work, a music sharing application was developed that broadcasts multimedia content from one vehicle to multiple receiving vehicles on the roadway. The infotainment application periodically broadcasts an ¡°electronic program guide¡± that indicates the available content. If a remote client is interested in the content (i.e., if a program guide tag matches the interest profile of the client), the electronic program guide message can be acknowledged and delivery will begin. For demonstration purposes, an interface was developed that enables the user to select audio content from the mobile device and broadcast the content to remote devices within communication range.  Since the wireless channel is lossy and packet drops may occur, mechanisms were developed to adapt to changing channel conditions and maximize communication throughput. Message fragmentation is used to increase the probability that the message will be received by the client at longer communication distances. Since the wireless channel is subject to fading, transmitting smaller packet sizes at longer communication distances will reduce the time that a message packet is exposed to the environment and increase the packet delivery ratio (PDR). When vehicles are within closer communication ranges, larger packet sizes can be used to improve throughput.  Since some packet drops are inevitable, a mechanism to recover dropped packets was developed. To obtain missing packets, receivers periodically respond back to the transmitter with the sequence numbers of packets that have not been received. The negative acknowledgments from all receivers are processed by the transmitter and subsequently rebroadcast to fulfill any outstanding requests.  Figure 4 shows an example music sharing session between two phones. In the example, the mp3 content is split into smaller fragments, transmitted over the air, and reassembled on the receiving phone. Missing packets are determined by the receiver by examining gaps in sequence numbers of packets that originate from the transmitter. These packets are assembled into one negative acknowledgment packet and communicated back to the transmitter. The transmitter collects the missing packet information from the receivers and retransmits the messages.    Figure 4 ¨C V2X Multimedia Content Sharing  Music content that is successfully received can be played back using the Play menu item. Selecting the Play menu item displays a list of music content that has been received from remote devices. A song can be played by selecting it from the play list.  There are numerous other applications that can utilize this form of localized communication including weather reports, location based services, multimedia and a variety of social networking applications.  SYSTEM PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS Tests were performed to measure the signal strength and communication reliability of the variety of Bluetooth devices used in this work. The Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) for each of the devices was obtained during the device discovery process and recorded for two different vehicle cabins. The Bluetooth standard provides for three different classes of transmission power. Class 1 devices are permitted to transmit at a maximum of 20 dBm (100 milliwatts). The devices used in this project are all Bluetooth Class 2 devices that use a transmit power of 4 dBm (2.5 milliwatts) with an antenna gain of 0 dBi. There is also a Class 3 standard that operates at 0 dBm (1 milliwatt) for low power applications. Given the short relative distances between devices within the vehicle cabin (1 to 2 meters), the communication signal strength between Class 2 devices is expected to be strong. Signal strength measurements were taken with the smartphone mounted on the windshield for both vehicles. Portable Bluetooth GPS receivers that were also used as part of this work were mounted on top of the roof of the vehicle, the production Bluetooth radio is located in the head unit (available on the CTS only), the CAN gateway module was installed into the OBD-II connector and the DSRC gateway was located in the trunk. The results are shown in Table 2.  Table 2: Received Signal Strength Indications (RSSI)  Device Cadillac CTS RSSI (dBm) Buick Lucerne RSSI (dBm) Wintec GPS -54 -58 QStarz GPS -54 -58 OnStar GPS -39 N/A CAN Gateway Module -38 -38 DSRC Gateway Module -42 -43  As seen from Table 2, the levels indicate that communication between the smartphone and other connected devices inside the vehicle cabin occur over a relatively strong and stable channel.  The communication reliability between the smartphone and connected devices was analyzed individually and during normal system operation. The GPS receiver and OnStar connections were examined for time stamp gaps to identify lost packets. The DSRC gateway connection was examined for gaps in sequence numbers to indentify lost packets. There was no observed packet loss on any connection during two separate 5 minute measurement periods. POSITIONING At the beginning of this work, the internal GPS of the smartphone was used in preliminary tests. The Android platform provides services that enable the application to obtain geographic location information for the device. Using this feature, the application is able to request location updates when the phone location has changed by a specified distance. A more direct means of acquiring location information is use the NMEA listener methods to automatically receive location updates at fixed time intervals (e.g., every 100 ms). Using the second approach, a thread was implemented to tokenize and parse the $GPRMC (Recommended Minimum Data) and $GPGGA (Global Positioning System Fix Data) GPS NMEA messages. The location accuracy of the Nexus One smartphone was not sufficient to support the road-level features that were developed as part of this system. The use of the internal phone GPS for V2X applications may be problematic in another respect. GPS chipsets consume a substantial amount of power because the radio must be constantly powered to capture the GPS signals and extensive digital signal processing is required to track individual satellite locations and produce a solution. From this standpoint, as well as from an antenna visibility standpoint (a smartphone located in the customer pocket, purse or on the windshield will have limited visibility of the sky), the vehicle is a much better source of location information. Multiple portable Bluetooth GPS receivers were used as positioning solutions. The receivers were modified so that they could be magnetically mounted to the roof of the vehicle to improve satellite visibility. The receivers under test each provide a 4 Hz position update rate. Two data collections were performed to measure the relative positioning performance between GPS receivers of the same type and mixed types. Figure 5 shows the mixed receiver performance.  Figure 5: Mixed Bluetooth GPS Receiver Performance The test data was collected over a 20 minute drive around the GM Technical Center. To support lane level features, a relative position of one-half a lane width is required. Since lane widths in the U.S. typically range between 3.4 and 3.7 m, a relative positioning performance of between 1.7 to 1.85 m is desirable. The results below indicate that while most of the time this level of precision can be achieved (in relatively benign environments), reliable lane level accuracy is not yet attainable using very low cost mixed GPS hardware. However, road level accuracy is achieved. Figure 6 shows the relative positioning performance between two identical receivers.  Figure 6: Same Bluetooth GPS Receiver Performance Figure 6 indicates that under benign conditions (i.e., light tree cover, minor obstructions from buildings) that the same GPS receivers are able to maintain lane level accuracy for long periods of time.  00.511.522.533.5136 71 10614117621124628131635138642145649152656159663166670173677180684187691194698110161051108611211156119100.511.522.533.54124 47 70 93 116139162185208231254277300323346369392415438461484507530553576599622645668691714737CONCLUSION Smartphone capabilities continue to advance in all aspects. The release of each new mobile device provides substantial advances in computing, storage and connectivity. As the demand for these devices continue to increase, the economies of scale will result in even more affordable devices. Numerous chipset manufacturers are announcing advanced chips that will appear on smartphones in the near future. At the time of this writing, the first dual-core smartphone chipsets have been deployed in the marketplace. Nvidia, Texas Instruments and Qualcomm have each announced future plans for dual-core and quad-core chipsets (7), (8), (9). The Nvidia announcement included a statement that their quad-core mobile device chip measures faster than an Intel 2-GHz Core2Duo computer processor according to one benchmarking standard. Ultimately the demand for portable, high performance mobile platforms will continue to drive innovation in consumer mobile devices. Long development cycles combined with the long lifespan of vehicles have made it challenging for automakers to lead in the deployment of advanced computing technology. An alternative architecture that supports seamless external device integration could help automakers to keep pace with current technology trends. The V2X smartphone integration concept was successfully demonstrated on a variety of vehicles equipped with a DSRC gateway. The demonstrations indicate that a smartphone-centric approach may be a viable solution for production vehicles and may help to accelerate the deployment of V2X technology. This type of solution may be especially appropriate for lower end vehicles due to low implementation costs and a customer base that has a high ownership rate of smartphones. Additionally, the integration of a smartphone into a passively equipped DSRC vehicle upgrades the performance of the system from ¡°Here I Am¡± functionality to a fully featured V2X system.

The two main goals of the project are first, the collection of data through mobile phones. The second goal is to develop new technologies to process and mine the collected data for crowd behaviour analysis. The technology will allow to make advanced interpretations of historic and dynamic mobile crowd data coming from GSM/GPS and from different classes of users (vehicle, pedestrian, indoor/outdoor). Fusion will be made between data coming from different sources (smartphone, navigation device) and external map data. The interpretation will allow the mining of advanced features/geometry from the crowd data as well as interprete the dynamic behaviour of the population.      2 INTRODUCTION The sector of wireless and mobile telecommunication is expected to play a pivotal role. Recent technological developments have produced a range of digital tracking technologies that offer a view on the movement of users, which has given rise to location based services (LBS). Tracking technology can be integrated with current mobile phones and PDA?s. The simple and standard solution is GPS-based devices. Less known is the fact that mobile phones also offer the possibility to track people constantly. Operating on a phone network requires the network operator to be able to constantly detect the subscriber's proximity to a specific antenna, even when no calls are made. In general, the accuracy of tracked mobile devices is lower than GPS-devices, ranging from 50 to 100m. Projects like MIT?s Senseable City investigate behaviour patterns through cell phone activity. The analysed activity is still limited to presence detection within a single cell tower range (typical resolution 100m) and does not take into account dynamic spatial movement patterns. However, activity during large events over the city of Amsterdam are clearly observed  The MOVE project pushes this technology into its next generation: UGent has specialized processing algorithms which enhances the bundle of collected position tracks from GPS or GSM through map matching and data mining. Enhancement is achieved of a full order of magnitude (e.g. 50m to 5m for GPS in urban canyons). More importantly, topology and movement behaviour is retained which allows dynamic models for crowd behaviour to be applied on the data. The extracted information on crowd behaviour can service markets like market research, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and security.  THE MOVE RESEARCH SETUP The MOVE project has two main goals. The first is the collection of data through mobile phones. The second goal is to develop new technologies to process and mine the collected data for crowd behaviour analysis.   DATA COLLECTION In order to collect data for crowd behaviour analysis, we have developed a mobile software application running on Android phones and Java Micro Edition. This application collects different kinds of valuable information and sends it to a central server. If the cell phone contains a gps chip, accurate locations of the phone can be collected. However, because gps is very demanding on the battery and does not work inside buildings, the gps is only used by the software when most appropriate. At other times, other information is used to derive the location of the phone as accurately as possible, such as the current and neighbouring cell towers, the wifi stations in sight and their signal strengths. On top of that, we also collect 3 measures of the accelerometer of the phones to help us distinguish between pedestrians, cyclists and cars. Currently, a group of students of the University of Ghent have installed this software and are constantly collecting data in and around Ghent, Belgium. Figure 1 shows the data that has been collected during the first two weeks of the trial.   Figure 1. Location data collected during the first two weeks of the trial.  DATA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY The location of individual phones in itself is not very useful. It only becomes interesting when the locations of many users together can be analyzed. However, going from these individual locations to crowd behaviour information, is still a large gap to bridge. Simple statistical analysis of the data can already be interesting, however, the truly interesting information is hidden and sophisticated technologies are needed to analyze the data. Since, the positional data derived from wifi and cell information is very inaccurate, the algorithms have to take into account this inaccuracy.   The proposed workflow to process the data consists of three stages:  ? In a first stage, the accuracy is enhanced and the geometry is extracted through a multidimensional rastering and fuzzy voting mechanism. This allows us to extract even the fine details of movement flows (see figures 2 and 3).  ? The second stage uses error tolerant graph matching to match the data with existing vector data such as road maps.  ? Thirdly, different local features are calculated on the data and data mining techniques, such as neural networks, are used to derive high quality crowd behaviour data.   Figure 2. Examples of deriving geometry from gps location data.  4 Two different methods are compared. On the left, the result of a two-dimensional rasterizing method is shown. The different flows cannot be distinguished here. On the right, a more dimensional rasterizing method is used. Here, all the different routes are extracted.   Figure 3. Example of the enhancement of accuracy through multidimensional rastering with fuzzy voting.  The detail of the cross-road shows that even fine details become visible.  MODELING MOBILE CROWD BEHAVIOUR  Individual position tracks as such hold limited information. Reports have to be generated that summarize critical aspects of crowd behaviour. UGent has specific know-how in the field of socio-economic geography and mobility, where the impact of behaviour patterns on transport, mobility and urban development is studied. The patterns are agent based, meaning that the complex behaviour of groups of people are modelled as the interaction of autonomous agents. This leads to a much more realistic and understandable model in terms of classes of user profiles. CONCLUSION The technology will allow to make advanced interpretations of historic and dynamic mobile crowd data coming from GSM/GPS and from different classes of users (vehicle, pedestrian, indoor/outdoor). Fusion will be made between data coming from different sources (smartphone, navigation device) and external map data. The interpretation will allow the mining of advanced features/geometry from the crowd data as well as interprete the dynamic behaviour of the population.   The technology has a broad market potential which will be explored within the project. The project will work towards creating value in the field of ITS, geomarketing and security. In addition, research will benefit from the large-scale data that will be collected during the project and additional funding which will be raised.

In this paper, we?re focused on the leverage of the information sharing/utilizing through some current probe vehicle information systems including smart-phone networks, hence we will discuss a basic framework to abstract a service architecture for probe vehicle systems for understanding the attributes of data and functions of probe vehicle information systems to share and cooperate the mutually referenced information.  Keywords: probe vehicle systems, service architecture, smart phone, standardization  2  INTRODUCTION Many probe vehicle information systems are now developed and deployed around the globe. The current trend of probe vehicle information systems is applied to collect sensing probe data from the dedicated in-vehicle devices but also smart-phones, PND, or nomadic devices. With this trend and the growth of multipurpose devices and telecommunication technologies such as mobile-phone networks and the Internet, novelty services leveraging the sensor data are developed in the ITS market.   The diversity of communication media and configuration for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Center (V2C) is emphasized. Though most of probe vehicle information systems are built as the specified service, and unrecognized their scores of collected probe data as the collective intelligence. This is far from sufficient to leverage the probe vehicle information. Sharing and some kinds of prove data could press for improvement in quality of services with low cost. However, that also causes a great deal of problems for data management such as the threat against personal data (1)(2], and difficulty of validation for freshness, reliability and granularity of probe data among some systems.   BACKGROUND AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEED The mainstream of probe vehicle information systems, called as automotive telematics, used to collect probe data by dedicated in-vehicle equipment. Nowadays there are some novel applications using probe data with smart-phone or some nomadic devices has been intergraded into many aspects of our lives not just ITS area, such as ecological services or shopping recommendations. These applications can make the probe information systems recognized, and have the economic effect of expanding markets of sensor data like probe vehicle information. There is much to be done for sharing valid data with some different probe vehicle information systems to enhance the applications even though the international standard for vehicle probe data for wide area communication (3). Coordinating services with some kinds of probe data collected by smart-phone or other nomadic devices could cause problems about the collision of type, reliability, and granularity of probe data among existing systems.  That is why we abstract the probe vehicle information systems including the sensing data from new devices, and discuss about the common terms and indexes, which shall be compliant with the international standards, to deliberate comprehensively with some different 3  systems including smart-phones and PND, and study about a basic framework for service architecture which will be consistent with various probe vehicle information systems.    PURPOSE As previously indicated, we will intend to make an abstraction of service architecture for some probe VEHICLE information systems to achieve mutual understanding objectively, and to enable to leverage the valid data among different probe vehicle information systems. That abstraction should be scalable and suitable for current, future applications.    APPROACH ?Probe vehicle information systems? can be broadly interpreted, and that mean, ?the several systems for probe data collection, processing, and dissemination?. The target of collecting probe data on broad probe vehicle information system is not limited for vehicles, and the origination can be small-fixed sensors or data on huge data constellation managed on the Internet [fig.1].   Fig.1: Probe vehicle information systems in a broad sense  In this study, we focus on the probe VEHICLE information system on the ITS area, so it is necessary to define/construe the boundary domain of probe vehicle information systems. As a matter of course it is included the system using multipurpose nomadic devices working on the mobile phone networks. After that construing, we will abstract and classify the common elements, functions, and attributes in terms of the data flow, and marshal service architecture in terms of the service flow or each use cases.  4  THE BOUNDARY OF PROBE VEHICLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS Existing ?probe vehicle systems?, ?vehicle sensor? and ?probe data? are defined as the following (ISO 22837:2009 [3], chapter 4: Terms and definitions).  4.1 probe vehicle system system consisting of vehicles which collect and transmit probe data and land-based centres which collate and process data from many vehicles to build an accurate understanding of the overall roadway and driving environment.  4.2 vehicle sensor device within a vehicle that senses conditions inside and/or outside the vehicle or that detects actions that the driver takes.  4.3 probe data vehicle sensor information, formatted as probe data elements and/or probe messages, that is processed, formatted, and transmitted to a land-based centre for processing to create a good understanding of the driving environment.  In this study, it needs to discuss and construe the boundary domain of probe vehicle information systems including the system using multipurpose nomadic devices working on the mobile phone networks, since we focus on the probe VEHICLE information system on the ITS area. However, the sensing devices on some probe information systems as the target of collecting probe data are not limited for vehicles, we construe that the ORIGINATION of probe vehicle information systems have to be a VEHICLE. The term ?the origination? means the source in terms of data flow, and it includes some sensor data from vehicle onboard equipments, from smart-phones on the seat, and from other nomadic devices in-vehicle, which can transmit as ?a probe data from vehicle? logically. ?A probe data from vehicle? means that a sensing data formatted as probe data elements and/or probe messages, and that binds the special and temporal information, which determine the position of the vehicle on the Earth?s surface. In addition, the origination vehicle of probe vehicle information systems includes two wheels. Thus, the probe vehicle information systems as our construe intend to collect sensing probe data from vehicle by not only the dedicated in-vehicle devices but also the multipurpose devices in-vehicle and telecommunication technologies such as mobile-phone networks and the Internet.   MARSHALING THE SERVICE ARCHITECTURE After that construe of domain of probe vehicle information systems, we will abstract and classify the common elements, functions, and attributes in terms of the data flow, and marshal 5  service architecture in terms of the service flow or each use cases.  In terms of the data flow The diversity of communication media and configuration for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Center (V2C) is emphasized. Though most of probe vehicle information systems are built as the specified service. Since our goal in this paper is to make a structured design for diversity of probe vehicle information systems, we intend to make an abstraction to achieve mutual understanding objectively, and make probe vehicle information systems to recognize their scores of collected probe data on the Earth?s surface as the collective intelligence.  The abstraction of probe vehicle information systems shall be re-constructible and extensible. With extracting some common elements, functions or attributes on the probe vehicle system, we may extract the elements of probe vehicle information systems as three series including two parts, and communication infrastructure to connect these elements. These series are ?Creation?, ?Processing?, and ?Dissemination? in terms of data flow, which origination is vehicle, and The series of ?Processing? consists of the two different parts: ?Collection? and ?Management?. The instance of specific elements for each series and parts are the following [fig2].  - Creation:  probe vehicle  - Processing: ¡þ Collection:  road equipment, vehicle as a transmitter ¡þ Management:  facility (server or database on the internet) - Dissemination:  users   6   Fig.2: The abstraction of probe vehicle information systems  ?Probe vehicle? in the Creation series is the origination vehicle on the Earth?s surface, and it creates probe data from vehicle onboard equipments, smart-phones on the seat, and other nomadic devices in-vehicle. After creating a probe data, probe vehicle will transmit them using some communication infrastructure such as wireless LAN or cell-phone networks. The samples of attributes for this series are two wheel / commercial / public / personal / emergency, or the type of communication devices, and so on.  In the Processing series, the part of Collection and Management are address per primam and secondary (n-th extension) probe data respectively. The instances of the Collection part in the Processing series are road equipments such as signals or vending machines on roadside, or vehicles as a transmitter that does not create probe data. They are specialized for probe vehicle information systems, and collect the primary probe data, that is, ?vehicle sensor information, formatted as probe data elements and/or probe messages? and do not include any personal information (3).  The instances of the Management part in the Processing series are some facilities on the communication infrastructure such as probe information centre or other application server / databases on the Internet. They are in common services, and receive primary probe data from the instance of the Create or the Collection, and manage them as the secondary or n-th probe data, that is, to process, format, store, and transmit to the other services for processing to create a good understanding of the driving environment. In this part, they may perform various processing / management primary probe data for the specific use such as personal 7  information protection, statistics analysis, or building a huge interoperable database. The samples of attributes for this part are service domains (i.e. public traffic information, weather news, environments analysis), communality, or anonymity.   The instance of the Dissemination series is users, such as web browser on the officer or car navigation system. They receive the n-th probe data, which created as a useful service of the driving environment by the instance of the Management. The instance and role of each series / parts is shown the following list [fig.3].   Fig.3: the instance and role of each element  The main functions of elements for probe vehicle information systems are communication, store and processing. In a case of ?communication?, the instances of the Create must have the ?send? function since they create probe data and send them to the instance of the Processing. The instances of the Collection in Processing must have the ?receive and send? function since they get the primary probe data from the instance of the Create, and send them to the instance of Management or Dissemination. Though the instance of Management have ?send? function since they provide the n-th probe data to the Dissemination, but the ?receive? function is optional. If the instance may perform the common service domain as the n-th server, they do not need to get any probe data. Thus, only ?send? function is essential for the elements of Management. For the instance of Dissemination, they must have the ?receive? as communication function.  As a future work, we will discuss the details of other attributes and functions such as the type of vehicle, the type of communication media, access control for database, data lifetime, frequency of update the database, synchronous requests with common services, and so on. 8  The number and kind of attributes / functions are different from each series or parts.   In terms of service flow To make the common terms or indexes to deliberate comprehensively with some different probe vehicle information systems, which have widely range of scale and purposes, it needs the level of requirements like accuracy or quality of information acceptable for the service providers. These requirements are derived from each use case or services. Thus, we may organize the service domain for probe vehicle information system in terms of service architecture, which origination is a service for users. The inquest about service domain is in terms of service flow, and needed for collaborative systems to counsel the concrete attributes and functions, such as data precision or time synchronization. For this inquest, we propose the piece of attributes for the element of probe vehicle information systems like the pieces of jigsaw puzzle [fig.4].  For example, the essential functions for the instance of the Create in term of data flow are ?to create probe data? and ?to send probe data?. In addition, the attributes for that instance are ?the type of vehicle? like two wheel or 4WD, ?the purpose of vehicle? like commercial / public / personal / emergency, ?the type of communication media (devices)? like smart-phone or PND, ?the frequency to send probe data?, or ?the purpose of service domain? like public weather information, traffic probe information or fuel control.      Fig.4: Piece for ?Create?   This piece of attributes for each element makes the relationship with different probe vehicle information systems simply as the service-oriented architecture in term of service flow. These attributes will be described as the common terms or indexes to consider the possibility of collaboration. We will design the details of these pieces to describe these levels of requirements and the relationship with other collaborative service domain as the future work.  9   Service domain The attribute in terms of service flow is construed depending on the service domain. We study some main service domains based on the report published by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan. Furthermore, we also discuss the newly common service, such as the consequential environment information or the lifelog based on the personal action history. As the result of our discussion, we consider the following two indexes are needed for organized service-oriented architecture; ?communality (sociality) or value-added differentiation? and ?anonymous (pseudonym) or autonym?    CONSIDERATION AND FUTURE WORKS In this paper, we?re focused on the leverage of the information sharing/utilizing through some current probe vehicle information systems including smart-phone networks. We discussed a basic framework to make an abstraction of service architecture for some probe vehicle information systems to achieve mutual understanding objectively, and to enable to leverage the valid data among different probe vehicle information systems. Thus, we construed the boundary of probe VEHICLE information systems, and extracted the elements in terms of data flow. To make the common terms or indexes with some different probe vehicle information systems, we also discussed the piece of attributes for the element of probe vehicle information systems, and organized the service domain for probe vehicle information system in terms of service architecture, which origination is in terms of service flow, and needed for collaborative systems to counsel the concrete attributes and functions. In this study, we offered a glimpse at the direction the collaboration with probe vehicle information systems including multipurpose devices and telecommunication technologies is taking. These abstraction and construe should be scalable and suitable for current and future applications, so we have to make these proposal more sophisticated, and will propose to the standardization at ISO/TC204/WG16, for exchanging / sharing the valid probe data from several probe vehicle information systems using any novel devices and media.

1  DECENTRALIZED PROBE VEHICLE SYSTEM USING 700MHz BAND WIRESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM  Keisuke UEHARA, Masaaki SATO, Jun Murai Faculty of Environmental Information, KEIO University 5322 Endo, Fujisawa KANAGAWA 252-0882, Japan Phone:+81-466-49-1394         e-mail: kei@wide.ad.jp  ABSTRUCT Probe vehicle system is one of innovative system in ITS area.  This paper introduces a kind of probe vehicle system called ?decentralized probe vehicle system? which uses V2V communication system instead of cellular phone and omits probe vehicle center system.  The system is also implemented in real vehicles using 700MHz band wireless communication system.  The developed system is tested in Tsukuba city, Japan.  As the result, several applications, including traffic information notification and eco-driving assistance, are works well with Advanced Safety Vehicle application.  Keywords: probe vehicle systems, decentralized system, wireless communication, 700MHz  INTRODUCTION Probe vehicle system (a.k.a. Floating Car Data) [1][2] is one of innovative system in ITS area.  Basic mechanisms of current probe vehicle system works as follows; 1) Vehicles send its sensing data, such as vehicle speed, to a probe vehicle center. 2) Probe vehicle center generate probe information, i.e. traffic condition, based on statistical analysis of sensing data. 3) Probe vehicle center provides probe information to vehicles using communication systems such as 3G cellular phones.  These systems are already well deployed.  In Japan, Honda started commercial service in 2003, Nissan started in 2006 and Toyota started in 2007.  These services are provided to their customers as an optional service.  Thus they don?t share probe data basically.  However, under the recovery phase of the big earthquake in March 2011 in Japan, they successfully collaborated to provide the maps what indicate which road can be go through.  This episode shows you a value of sharing the vehicle sensor data.  Even so, probe vehicle system has several bottlenecks. Vehicle probe center receives large number of sensing data.  Thus the communication interface of probe vehicle center can be a bottleneck.  In addition, probe vehicle center has to have enough processing power to generate probe information.  Furthermore, the operational cost of current probe vehicle is high since almost all of systems use 3G cellular phones.  2  To solve these problems, we introduce ?Decentralized probe vehicle system?.  The system uses vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication to exchange sensing data and probe information among vehicles.  The system does not need probe vehicle center and is completely decentralized (distributed) system.  This paper is constructed as follows.  In next section, the problem statement will be defined.  Then, we introduce the overview of our solution called Decentralized probe vehicle system.  The details of implementation of the system are shown in the next section.  After that, we test the proposed system and evaluate it.  Finally, we conclude this paper.  PROBLEM STATEMENT As described in the INTRODUCTION, current probe vehicle system has several problems.  First, the communication traffic is high.  At the present, since there is small number of probe vehicles, the amount of communication traffic is not so high.  However, the number of probe vehicle is increasing.  It can be a big problem in several years.  We need to have a solution of the problem for future.  Second, computational power of the probe vehicle center also can be a problem as same as communication traffic.  Probe vehicle center have to store many data and to process statistics.  In addition, the center system must do some special operation such as map matching depend on an application in some system.  These operations can be a heavily cost.  Third, economic issue is there.  Almost all of probe vehicle systems are using 3G cellular phone systems.  Thus somebody have to pay for it.  In a system, car manufacture pays for it.  In the other system, customers pay for it.  The number of probe vehicle does not affect to the cost per vehicle.  However it can be a barrier of deployment.  Forth, in current probe vehicle system has large number of stakeholders, car manufacture, ITC Company, system integrator and so on.  This can be also a barrier to start probe vehicle system service.  To deploy probe vehicle systems, these problems must be solved in few years.  OVERVIEW OF DECENTERLIZED PROBE VEHICLE SYSTEM To solve the problems we described in the previous section, we introduce ?Decentralized probe vehicle system?.  The system is a basically kind of a probe vehicle system.  However, it does not use wide area communication system.  It uses vehicle to vehicle communication 3  system basically.  The concept of Decentralized probe vehicle system is shown in Figure 1.  When the vehicle is in a traffic jam.  It generates traffic jam information.  Then, the vehicle passes the information to the other vehicle.  The received vehicle passes to the other vehicle, which needs the traffic information.  Any kind of information, such as weather information and sightseeing guide, can be disseminated in same way.   Figure 2 shows the system overview of the Decentralized probe vehicle system.  In the system, an on board unit (OBU) gets sensing data from various sensors of a vehicle with its location and time same as traditional probe vehicle system.  The sensing data will be stored to a message pool, which is implemented in OBU.  Message pool is a core component of decentralized probe vehicle system.  It stores both of sensing data and probe information as messages. The sensing message will be broadcasted to surrounded vehicles by the other software component, message disseminator, using V2V wireless communication system.  In the vehicle, which received sensing data message, the message will be stored to message pool.  By repetition of this operation, a vehicle will collect enough number of sensing data message for statistical analysis.  An application running on the OBU, such as traffic information notification application, generates probe information using sensing data.  Generated probe information can be disseminated using V2V communication same as sensing data dissemination mechanisms.   Figure 1: Concept of Decentralized probe vehicle system 4     IMPLEMENTATION We implemented decentralized probe vehicle system using 700MHz band wireless communication system.  Figure 3 shows hardware configuration and Figure 4 shows software components structure.  OBU is consists of in-vehicle-PC, 700MHz band wireless communication system, ECU interface and GPS.  Also the other V2V communication system, such as WiFi, can be used  Figure 2: System overview     Figure 3: Hardware configuration  Figure 4: Software components structure 5  instead of 700MHz band wireless communication system.  In fact, we have experiences to use of WiFi.  However, the WiFi has too small coverage in the starting phase.  At the starting phase, penetration rate of probe vehicle can be a small number.  It means there are small number of chance to communicate each other.  That is the one of reason why we decided to use 700MHz band wireless communication system.  700MHz band communication system has about 1,000m long coverage in our test.  Since basically Japanese 700MHz band wireless communication system is designed for Advanced Safety Vehicle (ASV) [3], we need to consider the possibility of coexistence.  It is used for safety purpose, the communication done by the ASV application shouldn?t be obstructed.  For this purpose, we introduced a mechanism to cooperate with ASV and Decentralized probe vehicle system.  The 700MHz band wireless communication unit inform the current status of the ASV communication to Decentralized probe vehicle system software using SNMP trap [4] as shown in Figure 5.  Using the information, Decentralized probe vehicle system software can control the amount of the communication.   In software side, it consists of two layers structure, platform layer and application layer.  Platform layer is designed to support any kind of application, which share information among vehicles.  In platform layer, there are several core components. Message Pool is a kind of database to store messages.  The collected sensor data and the information generated as the result of data processing are stored as the message with a message header.  Message header includes some metadata (node ID, application ID, message ID, expiration time, generated time, generated location, priority, dissemination strategy parameter and authentication signature).  Message Disseminator decides which message should be broadcast and pass the messages to Packet Sender.  The message disseminator priorities the messages based on the dissemination  Figure 5: Notification using SNMP trap 6  strategy.  Packet Sender makes IP packets and broadcast it via a 700MHz band wireless communication system.  Packet Receiver and Message Receiver receive and store a received message to Message Pool.    Applications are implemented top of the platform layer.  It gets sensing data with a position and a time from ECU and GPS, and stores them to Message Pool via the API.  After exchanging sensing information, Applications generate probe information using exchanged sensing data.  We implemented the ?circle dissemination strategy? as the one of dissemination strategy.  As shown in Figure 6, every message has the target position for dissemination.  When a vehicle is located near the target position of information A, the vehicle sends the message A.  When the vehicle is located in the coverage of both of message A and B, both of data will be sent by the vehicle.  Using this strategy, at the around the target position of message A, message A will be sent by vehicles more than the other message.  It means the vehicle can get the message A easily at nearby the target position of message A.   Message disseminator also has class-based queuing mechanism.  If one of applications uses very big data compare to the others, the application consume a big percentage of amount of traffic.  To avoid this situation, message disseminator has the class-based queue as shown in Figure 7.  Applications are categorized to classes.  And each class has the limitation of the traffic.  Figure 6: circle dissemination strategy 7    In packet sender, the other mechanism for fairness is necessary.  If one vehicle sends messages as link speed, the other vehicles cannot send any message.  To avoid this situation, we introduced traffic shaper and traffic control mechanism in the packet sender.  As mentioned before, 700MHz band wireless communication unit inform the available bandwidth (B) to packet sender, however, vehicles that located nearby must share the bandwidth.  To handle it, packet sender get the information of number of surrounded the vehicle from packet receiver.  Packet receiver counts the number of vehicles that are located nearby based on the received message.  If there are no other vehicles are in the coverage, half of the bandwidth will be used.  If there are one or more other vehicles (n vehicles) are in the coverage, B/n will be used by one vehicle as shown in Formula 1.  The calculation of the bandwidth will be done each one tick, which can be set by configuration (1 sec in default).   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are used as the Network layer protocol and Transport layer protocol.  So the developed system can use any kind of V2V communication system, which can use IPv6, very easily.    Figure 7: Queue structure of Disseminator !" ?! = 0 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?!2 !" ?! > 0 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?!! + 1 Formula 1 8  EVALUATION To evaluate the implemented system, field test is done in Tsukuba city, Japan.   In the field test, basic performance and functions are evaluated.  In addition, feasibility of decentralized probe vehicle system also evaluated using several applications.  In the basic performance and functions evaluations, following evaluations are done.  First, coverage of 700MHz band wireless communication system is measured.  As shown in Figure 8, communication rage of 700MHz band wireless communication system is wider than 1,000m.  The result shows us that vehicles can communicate each other even the penetration rate of probe vehicle is low.  Second, the SNMP trap mechanism is evaluated.  Packet Sender must control bandwidth that used by decentralized probe vehicle system, because it must not disturb ASV application traffic.  In the testing, Packet Sender is able to control sending rate based on number of surrounded ASV vehicles as shown in Figure 9.  As shown in Figure 9, when the SNMP trap mechanism is not introduced, the arrival rate of ASV traffic steeply decreases.  However, after introducing the SNMP trap mechanism, the decrease of arrival rate is similar with when the IP traffic is 3Mbps, even the IP traffic is 12Mbps.   Figure 8: Coverage of 700MHz band wireless communication system 9   Third, Packet Sender module is evaluated. Figure 10 shows the result of fairness test.  As the first, there are two vehicles.  Both of the vehicles send messages in about 3Mbps.  After about 40s, third vehicle comes in.  First two vehicles decrease the sending rate to about 2Mbps.  Third vehicle sends messages in about 2Mbps too.  Finally, all vehicles send messages in 2Mbps.   In addition, feasibility of decentralized probe vehicle system is evaluated using several applications.  Basically, traffic information notification and eco-driving assistance application worked well, even there are no cellular phone communication device and probe vehicle center.  Figure 11 shows the pictures of the field-testing.  Figure 10: Result of Fairness test  Figure 9: result of effectiveness of SNMP trap 10    CONCLUSION This paper proposed decentralized probe vehicle system using 700MHz band wireless communication system.  The system is also implemented and tested.  As the result, the mechanisms of decentralized probe vehicle system can be a platform of probe applications.  The platform provides to the application a platform to share the information among vehicles.  In addition, the proposed system can be operated with ASV system.  Since the system uses vehicle to vehicle system, the economical communication cost can be decreased.  The system can be developed in OBU only.  It means the system is easy to deploy.  As the future work, decentralized probe vehicle system should be merged with traditional probe vehicle system.  These two systems are not exclusion.  If the information, generated by decentralized probe vehicle system, will be sent to the prove vehicle center, the traffic and calculation load of the center system will be decreased.

There were no available field testing data in the literatureto demonstrate the potential of applying an innovative application of sideview cameras on tran-sit buses to reduce side collisions. It was uncertain whether transit bus drivers could use thesideview cameras to drive and be satisfied by its performance. This paper closely explores theabove-mentioned important questions and seeks to provide insights on transit drivers' satisfac-tion on using the sideview cameras on their driving. This paper offers valuable findings forfurther development of advanced sideview cameras for future transit buses. In this study, acomprehensive controlled driver test was designed, and conducted with a sample of bus driversinordertoevaluatetheeffectivenessofthesideviewvideosystem, andexaminepotentialissueswith its use on a regular basis. A well-designed driver survey and evaluation was performedbefore and after the test to capture the drivers' change in opinion for the system, if any. Thispaper especially focuses on the analysis of the driver survey on using the system to obtain theirfeedback to further improve the system for future widespread deployments. The result of thecontrolled driving test from 28 bus drivers was positive on distance/depth perception and lanechange maneuvers using sideview video systems. Most bus drivers who participated in the con-trolled driver test were satisfied with the sideview video system, and believed the system couldbe further improved for actual deployment in the future.INTRODUCTIONOne of the major reasons that side crashes occur if the bus drivers are at fault is that the driverscannot see other vehicles or objects in the blind zones of the mirrors of the bus. This brings thebus drivers into situations where they cannot see vehicles approaching from the side, especiallyduring lane changing maneuvers. The camera-based system has great potential to significantlyreduce or eliminate the blind zone of mirrors, thus reducing transit bus side crashes.OBJECTIVESThe primary objective of the study described in this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness ofcamera-based systems to reduce transit bus side crashes in a controlled environment, under-stand drivers' satisfaction and behavior on using camera-based systems on driving, and obtaintheir feedback for further enhancement of the system. To achieve this objective the team had toperform several steps:1. Compare available systems, including mirror-, sensor-, and camera-based technologies,to reduce transit bus side and other collisions.2. Measureblindzonereductionsonthesideofcommontypesoftransitbusesusingcamera-based systems.3. Design, conduct, and analyze transit bus driving tests with and without camera-basedsystems in a controlled environment.4. Conduct and analyze transit bus driver surveys on driver satisfaction for using camera-based systems on lane changes.1This paper focuses on the design and analysis of the driver survey used before and after thedriving test. This survey is crucial to understanding driver behavior, use of the technology,acceptance of the system, and willingness to use it in the future. Based on previous research,new technologies used on transit or commercial vehicles usually fail if the drivers do not acceptthe technology and use it. Even if the technology is very effective, drivers need to try it first,and approve of it in order to be widely accepted.SIDEVIEW VIDEO SYSTEMThe camera-based system for transit buses under evaluation in this study was a system thatincorporates video cameras installed on the outside walls of the bus, aimed at the left and rightrear sides of the bus, and two monitors connected inside the bus to provide the driver withan image from the cameras. Previous research on this matter included sensor-based systemscovering all areas around the bus. Those systems used proximity sensors to scan the areaadjacent to the bus and provide the driver with an audible warning for eminent hazard. Thosesensor systems were deployed with transit agencies and tested, with some success. A majorissuewasthatthe sensors werenot reliabletheentire time, i.e., theydid notperformcontinuousdetection or missed objects. In addition, the sensor systems that were tested provided falsealarms to an uncomfortable level, rendering the systems unusable by drivers. The comparisonof mirrors and camera systems from this study showed that the side blind zones that exist dueto the mirrors' inability to cover the area were greatly reduced or eliminated when using thesideview video system with wide angle cameras.CONTROLLED DRIVING TESTThe camera-based technology for transit buses to reduce blind zones is fairly new, so there isno crash data associated with the implementation of the technology. The approach selectedin this study was to closely evaluate the aftermarket sideview video system using a controlleddriving test that simulated reality scenarios. The participating bus drivers performed the con-trolled driving tests with and without using the sideview video system. The controlled drivingtest had two parts: the first was to provide the drivers with a maneuver test to establish if thedrivers could drive using the video system instead of the mirrors and to determine if they valuethe benefits of having such a system. The second part was to obtain feedback from the driversabout possible setup locations and monitor size and orientation, as well as enhancements tomake the sideview video system more attractive for use through a driver survey taken beforeand after the driving test.The controlled driving test would help in two aspects: provide the opportunity to collect datawhile drivers used the system to perform maneuvers that simulate everyday driving, and theopportunity for drivers to experience the system in a safe manner, thus gaining the necessaryexperience to later infer on the system's ability to perform. The latter would be collected witha driver survey designed to obtain feedback from the drivers about the system's features andeffectiveness in the given task: to present the surrounding environment similarly to the mirrors.2TEST DESIGNThe test consisted of three parts:1. Pre-maneuver driving course2. Distance/depth perception exercise under static conditions3. Driving maneuvers under dynamic conditionsThe three parts were designed to address the objectives outlined earlier. A closed loop drivingcourse was designed to provide drivers with a limited time to experience the sideview videosystem and use it before they performed the driving maneuvers. This allowed for some learn-ing and exposure time. The course consisted of some left and right turns and a lane changemaneuver. Before the drivers drove the course, they were advised to use the sideview videosystem as they would have used their side mirrors in order to follow the course and make surenottohitanytrafficcones. Theturnshadatightradius, sothatthedrivershadtobeverycarefulwhen passing through. After the drivers drove the bus around the closed course two times, theyproceeded to perform the next part of the test unless they felt they needed more time to getfamiliar with the system.DRIVER SURVEYDriver surveys were given to the participating drivers before and after they performed the testmaneuvers. A set of questions was asked before and after the drivers took the test so a com-parison of before and after responses could be performed. Of the 28 drivers, 3 experienced Figure 1: Age distribution of participating drivers.incidents where, while turning the bus, the mirrors struck tree branches (for 2 drivers) and a ce-ment pillar (for one driver). The sample size was 28 drivers, and their age distribution is shownin Figure 1. They had an average of 9.9 years of driving experience, from 0.5 years to 52 years.Eleven drivers had previous experience with a camera-based system (rearview video system)for at least one week. Two drivers experienced a previous side crash. Two bus types were used3 Figure 2: The cutaway transit bus. Figure 3: The lowfloor transit bus.in the test. The first was the cutaway bus shown in Figure 2, and the second was a low floortransit bus shown in Figure 3. The responses to the questions are shown separately for eachtype of bus. The numbers in parentheses show the number of responses for each category. Onemust keep in mind that although there were two types of buses, the replies can still be binnedinto the same answer categories. For example in Figure 4 the total replies for the category¡±strongly agree¡±are six: 4 for the cutaway and 2 for the low floor bus. The questions shownin Figures 4 & 5 were asked before the controlled driving test to highlight specific problemsthat mirrors inheretivley have, but can be potentially improved with the sideview video system.The replies to the questions show the agreement of the drivers to the two problems: rain andnighttime render mirrors inefective in providing a good view of sides of the bus.4 Figure 4: Driver responses on survey question: Do you agree that the side mirrors be-come less effective during rainy weather due to water droplets on the window glass andmirrors?Shown in Figure 4, all drivers agreed that the mirrors become less effective when in rainyweather because the mirror and glass window accumulate water droplets, making it difficult tosee through them. The camera-based system, however, is shown to provide a better view, evenin rainy weather. Shown in Figure 5 the majority of drivers (90%) agreed that it is difficult to Figure 5: Driver responses on survey question: Do you agree that it is difficult to identifyan object/person with the side mirrors during nighttime?identify a person or object using the mirrors under nighttime conditions unless it is illuminated(such as a vehicle with headlights). The camera-based system provides a better image underdark conditions, since infrared LEDs illuminate the area so that the camera can provide a betterimage. The questions shown in Figures 6-10 were asked before and after the controlled drivingtest to compare the drivers preferences. The two different columns in the graphs represent thetwo types of buses tested. The striped pattern represents the cutaway bus, whereas the whitebar represents the low floor transit bus. Shown in Figure 6 the majority of drivers (85%) agreedthat the system reduces or eliminates the side blind zones before the test, with an increase (to90%) after the test. In Figure 7 the same results as before are seen for this question as well.The majority of drivers (85%) agreed that the system can help reduce potential side crashes by5 Before Test  After Test  Figure 6: Driver responses to survey question: With the sideview video system, the sideblind spots are reduced/eliminated compared to conventional mirrors.

ShowninFigure 9, most of the drivers (71%) agreed with this statement before the test, and 68% agreedafter the test. Most drivers mentioned that it was difficult to answer this question before theycould use the system, and even after they had some exposure, it was still very difficult for themto respond with certainty because the time spent with the system was not enough. Shown inFigure 10, the responses for this question were somewhat mixed and the drivers did not seem toform a specific opinion, even after they took the test. In absolute numbers, 60% agreed beforethe test and 46% agreed after the test. This shows that the drivers do not seem to agree onreplacing mirrors with a sideview video system.A statistical paired t-test was performed to identify if the changes to the responses (Ques-tions 6-10) were attributed to the system. The test shows that there is no evidence to show thatthe changes are attributed to the system even if there is high correlation between some pairs6Before Test  After Test   Figure 8: Driver responses to survey question: In general, the sideview video system canimprove bus safety.

The hypothesis was that the system, providing theside views required to the drivers would compensate for the shortcomings of sideview mirrors,i.e. blind zones. These blind zones are the major cause of side crashes for transit buses. Usingthe sideview video system, the drivers can see more area next to the bus, thus eliminating theblind zones and possible side crashes.Based on previous research, aftermarket telematic devices that are present to aid the driversin certain situations are not always welcome and a lot of effort has to go into how it will beintroduced to the drivers so they can accept it and therefore use it (1, 2). In the case of thesideview system used in this test, the objective was to evaluate if it is possible to replace themirrors with the sideview video system. The survey was designed to extract the feedback ofdriversbeforeandaftertheyperformedthetest, thusassessingthechangeintheiropinionaboutthe system.Based on the responses to the questions, the majority of drivers did understand what the side-view system can offer, and how it can help to reduce or eliminate side crashes. In more detail,the majority of drivers agreed that:The system reduces or eliminates the side blind zone compared to the mirrorsThe system can help drivers reduce side crashes by providing a better viewIn general the system can improve bus safetyWith the system they can observe late arriving passengersThey would like to have this system on the bus they drive everydayThey felt comfortable performing a lane change maneuver with the systemThe system can help reduce crashes during lane change maneuversThe positive feedback received from drivers participating in this test, ties with the upcomingwork to be conducted in the near future. Although the idea of replacing the mirrors withcameras is still in concept stage, the sideview video system can be used as an additional visualaid to the bus drivers to help reduce or eliminate side crashes for transit buses.REFERENCES(1) Lin, P.S., Lee, C and Kourtellis, A, Evaluation of the Power Line Motor Carrier RearviewVideo System, FDOT, Tampa, FL, 2009(2) Ball, D., Versluis, S., Hendrickson, R.A., Pittenger, J., Frank, B., Stewart, A., and Murray,D., Factors in Decisions to Make, Purchase, and Use On-board Safety Technologies, USDOT,Washington D.C., 200511

Automated vehicles require an accurate and robust representation of the environment in which the vehicle is moving.  This paper describes the data fusion techniques used in the HAVEit project. First an overview of the system is presented. The next section explains the sensor fusion architecture, where the data flow from sensors to percep tion output is presented. Afterwards, the lo cal and global tracking processing and filtering algorithms are presented. In the final section of the paper, the results from the testing of the developed algorithms are presented. HAVEit JOINT SYSTEM The objective of the sensor and data fusion system is to support the function of the automation system in the demonstration vehicle. Starting with sensor da ta fusion, the Co-System part of the Joint Systems plans manoeuvres and tra jectories, that are then used to control active interfaces and, taking into account the results of an online driver assessment, are then joined with the actions of the driver. HAVEit addresses especially the region of highly automated driving, where th e vehicle has the technical capabilities that it could drive fully automated, but this capability is used in a way that the driver is always meaningfully involved in the driving task. HA VEit also addresses the transitions b etween different levels of assi stance (Figure 1) and automation. Ideally, this is done in a way the driver can be relieved in overload and underload conditions. This task repartition between driver and automation or co-system can be dy namically influenced by  both th e driver and the co-system, and is esp ecially investigated in the HAVEit horizontal subproject ¡°Joint System¡±. 2  Figure 1 HAVEit automation spectrum  Figure 2 HAVEit Joint System Demonstrator vehicle FROM SENSORS TO PERCEPTION OUTPUT The sensor system delivers i nformation about the environment of the ego vehicle and also  data re garding the e go ve hicle¡¯s state of motion. The  da ta fusion system receives a nd processes the available sensor data. The data fusion outpu t describes the state of the ego vehicle relative to the environment. Additionally, important entities of the road environment are also d escribed. Th e per ception model, which emanates from the data fusion m odule, provides an  e stimate for the lanes a nd obstacles in the re gion around the ego vehic le. Additionally, the relations among the ego vehicle, the lanes and the neighboring obstacles are also described. Some examples of this kind of relational data are ego vehicle¡¯s and obstacles¡¯ lane assignment, the heading of other vehicles relativ e to the ego vehicle etc. The output of the perception system should describe the environment in one unified description by fusing the independent sensor data.   3 TARGET TRACKING AND DATA FUSION  Figure 3 Data fusion architecture  Data fusion techniques in automotive area have been extensively studied in the recent years (1) and many approaches have been investigated. Since the installed sensors on the test vehicles perform a first data processing, the track level fusion technique (2) was chosen. The sensor system was used in a car demonstrator. The sensor system used is illustrated in Figure 3.In general, data fusion is executed in two distinctive levels: the sensor level processing and the central lev el. In sensor level d ata proce ssing, a  de dicated local tra cker processe s the corresponding data. The local tracker executes the tasks of assigning sensor measurements to tracks and the estimation of a tracks¡¯ state from these measurements. The track list is finally updated by deleting old tracks or confir ming new ones. In the central level, the track lists from the local trackers are associated and fused after they have been aligned in time and space. The global tracker performs the ID maintenance and track management tasks. The tracker  algorithm¡¯s data flow is illustrated in Figure 4. Tracks are associated with measurements after the gate computation, using the G lobal Nearest Neighbor data association. Afterwards, the track states are estimated after they  have been updated with t he associated measurement. Track management finally updates the tracks list, by deleting old tracks or c onfirming new ones.   4  Figure 4: Tracker flow diagram Measurement to trac k association ass ociates the track list stored in the t racker from the previous scan, with the sensor measurements received from the current scan. Firstly, for each measurement that falls inside the gate of a track, the Mahalanobis distance ijd  between this measurement jy  and the corresponding track ix~  is calculated as follows(3) : ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þjTjTijySydRHPHSkxCkykInn~~~12 ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ If ijd  is smaller than the gate size ijG , the track score ija is calculated, otherwise the track score is zero.  Figure 5: Gate Computation The result of the gating is a matrix like the one shown in Figure 5. Afterwards, the assignment problem illustrated in Figure 6 has to be solved. This is a profit maximization problem and the auction algorithm is used for solving it (5). The elements ijx are either 0 or 1, whereas the constraints indicate that one measurement can only be associated with  one tar get, and one target can only be associated with one measurement. 5 ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þnimjnjijniijijijixjxconstraxaC1111,1,1intmax  Figure 6 The association problem The track management algorithm is based on the use of rules for track confirmation. The results of the data association are used. The un-associated measurements are initialized as tentative tracks and the corresponding track is assigned with a unique ID number. The tracks (tentative or confirmed) that have been associated with a measurement have their ¡®HIT¡® value increased by one, whereas the unassociated ones have their ¡®MISS¡¯ value increased by one. Afterwards the track management checks the HIT and MISS values for ea ch track. Th e algorithm used for track deletion and confirmation is presented in Figure 7.  Figure 7: Track management algorithm The track state update process is the final step of the tracking algorithm and is highlighted in Figure 8. In th is st ep in the  track l ist there a re tracks th at are ass ociated wi th a sensor measurement from the current scan, and also tr acks that remain un-associated. If a track is  associated, a Ka lman filter algorithm (4) es timates the track state at the current scan. For a non-associated track, the state estimation is predicted using a motion model and the track state from the previous scan. 6   Figure 8: Track state update algorithm The track fusion module takes as input the track lists of the local trackers and gives a single track list in the output.  The trac k-to-track association module identifies which tracks from different tracks l ist rep resent th e s ame ob ject. The proc edure is s imilar to the track to  measurement asso ciation, exc ept t hat the M ahalanobis distance (6) of t he two trac ks i s calculated as follows: ¡þ ¡þ ijijijijijijjiijij xSxxPPPPxd ~~~~ 112 ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ  The fused estimate of the two independent estimates is (7) ¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ ijijijijjiijjiijii xSxxxPPPPPPxx ~~~~~~ 11 ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ As described, the track fusion giv es to th e global trac ker a  sing le track list. Th e gl obal tracker¡¯s tasks are similar to the local¡¯s. The difference lies in the input, where the global tracker uses a fused track list while the local one uses the sensor measurement list. FILTERING ALGORITMS Ego Filter When the ego filter is called, two separate Kalman filters are executed. These two filters form the ego filter¡¯s state vector. The longitudinal model makes use of the CTRA (constant turn rate and acceleration) model (9). The lateral filter processes lane and vehicle data and with the use of the CA (constant acceleration) model, the lateral dynamics of the vehicle are estimated (10). The ego filter algorithm is depicted in Figure 9.  7  Figure 9: Ego filter algorithm Lane Filter Lane detection camera data are filtered with the use of an additional Kal man filter. Th e filtered output is used to extract the lane geometry. In the extraction, lane markings are used in order to identify the types of adjacent lanes.     Figure 10: Lane filter algorithm The geometry interpolation is done under the assumption that road follows the clothoid model equation(8):     Where h is the heading relative to the lane, 0c  is the curvature at point ),( 00 yx , 1c is the curvature rate and l is the curvilinear coordinate from its i nitial position. The la ne filter algorithm is depicted in Figure 10. Relative Position Estimation Filter This algorithm estimates the position and the heading of the ego vehicle relative to an initial coordinate system ),( 11 YX . The main use of this module is for estimating the position of the vehicle with respect  to a ground  fixed  trajec tory deliv ered fro m the trajectory plannin g algorithm. The coordinate system is set every time the filter is reset, this is done when a new ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ62tan31200xcxcxhyxy ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þlccc ¡þ¡þ¡þ108 trajectory is delivered to the control algorithm. When the  filter is called, a Kalman based algorithm estimates the position and the heading relative to the initial coordinate system. In addition, the filter can be updated by the sensor data (speed, yaw rate) so that the estimation remains accurate even if the vehicle executes highly dynamic manoeuvres in the longitudinal or the lateral axis. In Figure 11 the vehicle dynamics are presented in different moments of relative position estimation.  Figure 11 Relative to trajectory position calculation IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS The tracking pe rformance wa s teste d in som e b asic s cenarios in D LR¡¯s tes t tr ack a t Braunschweig. These included s topping b ehind a stand ing object , lane change, veh icle following and emergency stop. Overall the tracking maintained the track ID throughout all the scenarios and could correctly assign object s to lanes within 70 meters with almost 100% success. Here will be presented the emergency brake scenario since it is the most interesting for validation the perception output. Figure 13 shows the track estimation history when an object appears suddenly in front of the ego vehicle. It can be seen that the object is detected steadily while the ego vehicle decelerates (relative velocity is negative and finally becomes zero).

Data fusion t racking module tracks the object even if this is o utside of the lanes, but it doesn¡¯t report it to the other modules. As soon as the object moves in the road it is outputted to the data fusion, so the co-pilot and control modules can take proper action. As it can be seen in F igure 13 the obj ect is tracked and the rel ative longitudinal v elocity is decreasing to zero, indicating the automation action to emergency brake.   The estimated lane geom etry (coming from the lane detection camera), was co mpared with the lane geometry coming from a very accurate map and DGPS position. Even if the errors of the DGPS (position and heading) and the map error are accumulated to the overall calculated error, this comparison gives an estimation of the upp er bound of lane estimation error. As shown in Figure 14, up to a range of 65 meters the lateral estimation error is below 1m.  10 0 20 40 60 80-3-2-101234567Lonitudinal estimation distanceLateral error  Average Lateral error Figure 14 Lane estimation error The position filter estimation was compared with the DGPS recorded position that was used as the ground truth.

The results showed that the maximum calculation time of the fusion algorithm is 24 milliseconds.

Image sensors for cooperative DSSS are required to have extremely high performance under any condition changes or environmental noise. However, there have been no known image sensor systems to meet the requirements. Therefore, we developed our own image sensor system. Inputs to the system are gray-scale images from a roadside video camera. The system consists of a detector and a t racker. The detector is based on histogram of oriented gradient feature and support vector machine trained with a newly developed efficient training method. The tracker is based on discriminative pixel-pair feature. Since both a detector and a tracker are of high-performance, they enables to correct miss of detection, error of size, position, or both, and false positives. Moreover, since the inputs to  th e s ystem a re gray-scale i mages, ex isting r oadside ca meras can  b e easily converted to image sensors for cooperative DSSS. The results of our experiments shows that the proposed system detects each vehicle with less than 1.0% misses and one false positive per frame, and can be processed in 30ms per frame in average. In addition, the system is robust to condition changes or environmental noise.

This largely depends on i mprovements in medical t echnology and t he s pread of  va rious kinds of  i n-vehicle s afety equipment. T he numeric target ¡°Less than 5,500 traffic fatalities and less than 1,000,000 fatalities or injured people in total in 2010¡± has been achieved two years earlier than planned. Given this situation, National P ublic S afety Commission is w orking o n t raffic s afety t o ac hieve t he t arget of ¡°Reducing traffic fatalities to half or less than 2,500, in 2018 and to become the most safety country in the world.¡± Analysis of the accident situation by National Police Agency shows that the reason of more than 60 pe rcent of  t he accidents i s rear-end collision, he ad-on c ollision, or  t urning r ight collision. The law violation in more than three quarters of the accidents is the violation of safe driving pr actice ( such as l ack of  s afety c heck, l ooking a side w hen d riving, or  l ack of confirmation of traffic movement). In order to achieve the target of National Public Safety Commission, it is necessary to realize the cooperative DSSS (Driving Safety Support Systems), in which infrastructure equipment and in-vehicle equipment cooperate to prevent an accident that cannot be prevented with each equipment only. Figure 1 shows an example of cooperative DSSS for a crossing. The image sensors should spot automobiles, motorcycles or pedestrians in a d river¡¯s blind corners, and measure the object¡¯s pos ition, s peed and di rection of  m ovement. T hen, c ommunications between infrastructures and vehicles by radio provide the obtained traffic data and images to drivers, or offer drivers the information, and drivers can prevent collision or other traffic accidents. As shown in this example, various technologies such as sensors, communication systems and traffic signal control are essential for the cooperative DSSS.     Figure 1.

However, the image sensors for cooperative DSSS are required to have extremely higher performance compared with the conventional image sensors such as traffic flow counters. For example, c ooperative D SSS r equire a lmost 100%  de tection f or ve hicles, and t he performance has to be reserved under any condition changes or environmental noise, while traffic flow counters usually allows about 10% error under some conditions. In addition, the detection of  m otorcycles ha ve t o b e ensured i n c ooperative D SSS s ince t hey are of ten involved i n s erious or  f atal accidents, w hile t raffic flow co unters d oes n ot at tach g reat importance to motor cycles since they have little influence on traffic flow. There have been no know n image sensor systems to meet such requirements essential for cooperative D SSS. The pr evious algorithms for de tection a nd t racking show poor  performance under some environmental condition, such as illumination change, shadows or reflectance on the road surface, or occlusion of the tracking target by other vehicle. Therefore, we developed our own image sensor system that is based on the HOG and SVM detector and the discriminative pixel-pair feature tracker. The features of the method proposed in this paper are that it  is robust to condition changes or environmental noise, meets the requirements to detect each vehicle or motorcycle with high accuracy, a nd is a r eal-time processing.

Moreover, since inputs to our system are supposed to gray-scale images, existing cameras for traffic flow counters can be easily converted to image sensors for vehicle detection. Common specifications of image sensor systems for cooperative DSSS in Japan is now under consideration, so we set original target specification shown in table 1, which is based on the experience of our previous projects.

TRAINING OF A DETECTOR Figure 3 shows t he o utline of  t raining of  a detector. To train a vehicle detector, hand labeled square training images of ve hicles and pa ved r oad surface are used as positive data and negative data respectively. First, an initial detector is trained. Procedure of training of the initial detector is as follow: 1. Select subset of the samples randomly. 2. Train a detector for the subset. 3. Check the performance for all the samples 4. Repeat 1 to 3, and pick up the best detector. Each training time and memory size required in this method is relatively small since detectors are trained for only small subset of the samples. In addition, generalization i s ensured by ve rifying the performance for all the samples. The initial detector scans across images, and m isses of de tection and false positives are collected by ha nd. Then they are added to the training image data set. Additive training is performed with the Incremental SVM technique (2). With the Incremental SVM technique, additive training data set can be included in the existing detector without re-training from scratch. This training method, along with some other improvements, achieves a high-performance detector within a realistic training time. Since our method can handle a large set of samples, by using mixture of samples collected from various sequences, one common detector, i.e. detectors that does not depend on t arget places, can be trained with the balance between generalization and performance. A detector for motorcycles is trained in the same way as a detector for vehicles, but hands labeled square training images of vehicles are included in negative data in addition to images Figure 3. Training of the Detector Scan & Detection Detector Additive Positive Samples Additive Negative Samples Additive Training with Incremental SVM Miss of detection False positive or Position Error Training SVM Negative Samples Positive Samples Initial Detector  - 6 -  of paved road surface. DETECTION The final detector scans across target area of the frame. We set measuring range, and change the range of detection window according to the vertical position in the frame. With these restraints, we can suppress the number of scans per frame. Multiple detections will usually occur around each vehicle or motorcycle in a scanned image, and the same is often true of false positives. However, in cooperative DSSS, it is essential to return one final detection result per object. Therefore, overlapping detections are combined into a single detection based on the output value of the SVM for each. With some assumptions specific to vehicles and motorcycles, we can pinpoint the vehicles or motorcycles with high precision, and suppress false positives to one or less per frame.  TRACKING Since the inputs are gray-scale images, and may contain partially occluded or low-contrast vehicles, or  i llumination c hanges because o f traffic c onditions on the r oad, t racking algorithms based on color such as mean-shift algorithm, or template matching are difficult to be applied. Therefore, a new tracking algorithm is necessary. We define a t racking problem as a cl assification problem of obtaining an image patch that contains the object in the correct position from a new image frame. Under this definition, we need feature value and a detector that can detect the image patch with the track target in its center and other patches. We a dopt t he pi xel-pair feature, w hich is de fined b y difference of intensity of two pixels in  a n ima ge, as  a  feature f or tracking ( 3) ( 4). Figure 4 shows the definition of similarity of images based on pi xel-pair f eature. This feature i s ex pected to a ssure robustness t o c hanges i n illumination conditions, sensitiveness to position error, and low c omputation c ost, since i t ba sed on onl y difference of intensity of two pixels.

At f rame T, select  pixel-pair features to minimize t he similarity between the correct i mage patch I (i.e. the target of  tracking) and incorrect image patches Js, w hich a re near the co rrect i mage p atch (figure 5). 2. At f rame T+1, s earch t he image patch that is the most similar to I on the pixel-pair features selected above. The image patch is the result of tracking. We refer such pixel-pair features as selected in above procedure as discriminative pixel-pair features. Accuracy of discrimination between correct and incorrect image patches is secured by selecting adequate discriminative pixel-pair features. POST PROCESS Since we use a p lace-independent detector, there should be place-dependent errors, such as false detection of pavement marking on t he road surface. This post process handles such errors. By comparing the results of both detection and tracking, we can correct errors such as miss of detection, false positive, and error of position and/or size. For example, if an object is once detected as a vehicle, but its movement (result of tracking) is not typical for vehicle, the object and the first detection of the object are judged as ¡°not a vehicle¡± and ¡°false positive¡± respectively. The i nformation of  miss of  de tection or  f alse positive c an be  us ed a s s amples f or ot her additive training of the detector. EXPERIMENT TEST SEQUENCES We selected 5 test sequences for the experiment, in which it was difficult for the conventional vehicle detection methods due to environmental change or noise, or tracking of the tails of the vehicles. Descriptions of the selected sequences are shown in table 2. Figure 5 shows a typical Figure 5. Selection of the discriminative pixel-pair features.

Therefore, t he d etectors w ere robust t o environmental change or noise in various sequences. The minimum size of detection was 16x16 pixels (vehicles), and 8x16 pixels (motorcycles). In calculation of HOG feature, we extracted 8x8-pixel cells overlapping each other by half size. Therefore, 9 cells were set in a 16x16-pixel image. We set the number of bins of the edge direction to 8. Thus, the number of the feature vector dimensions was 72. RESULTS Vehicles or motorcycles that were not detected properly (i.e. the detected window did not contain the center of the ground truth, or size error is larger than 50% of the size of ground truth) during passing through the image w ere c ounted as misses.

The causes of the misses in the experiments were classified as follow:  ¡þ Position error (Detected and tracked part of a vehicle such as a bumper, roof, and so on) ¡þ Size error (Detected and tracked part of a large vehicle) ¡þ Type error (Mistook a motorcycle as a vehicle) ¡þ Hidden behind other vehicle ¡þ Blur of Input Images ¡þ Lights of the target vehicle (head or tail) were off or dim Table 5 shows causes of misses of detection in the experiment.

From this point of view, misses caused by the former 4 reasons are not critical. On the other hand, misses by the latter 2 reasons can be critical because there is no detection for a missed vehicle. However, improvement of imaging device can solve the problems. Therefore, no misses are critical for cooperative DSSS. Improvement of accuracy of position and size of detections are our future work. CONCLUSIONS We have proposed a vehicle measurement method for the cooperative DSSS. The method mainly consists of  2 s teps, de tection ba sed on  H OG a nd SVM, and tracking ba sed on   - 12 -  discriminative p ixel-pair f eature t racker. M isses o f d etection an d false p ositives can  b e removed by comparing the results of detection and tracking. Secondly, we have presented a set of experiments in 5 sequences, in which it was difficult for the conventional vehicle detection methods due to environmental change or noise, or tracking of the tails of the vehicles. The results of the experiments shows that our system is of high accuracy, robust to environmental noise or changes, fast enough for real-time processing, and sufficient for cooperative DSSS.

The Spatio-Temporal MRF(S-T MRF ) model ex tracts and tracks for eground objects, under the assumption that background motion of camera can be approximated by a linear function. By this method, both  pedestrians and non -pedestrians should be seg mentated from background motion. Then, Reg ion of Interest (RO I) is cl assified by a casc aded classifier. However, segmentaion result sometime contains error due to the motion of pedestrian. We improved the performance of ou r system by contaminating errors including in foreground objects. After considering the geometrical understanding, the motion difference, and HOG information, we combined those features to correct the result of segmentation. We confirmed this combination approach drastically improved the performance of pedestrian detection.   I. INTRODUCTION  In the last decade, as ne eds for pedestrian protection system grow rapidly, the methods for on-board pedestrian detection have been intensively studied. There are two major approaches for pedestrian detection ¨C lidar- and  vision-based approach. The lidar se nsor can d etect the presence of the objec t by scanning planes horizontally. The laser sc anner is widely used for detecting forward vehicle (1), but not appropriate for pedestrian detection as a sing le sensor due to low spatial r esolution (2) . On the oth er hand, vision-based methods detec t the  pedestrian based on imag es. Generally, as images fr om on-board camera include plentiful  information such as texture and sequential motion difference, vision-based approach performs better than lidar- approach.  - 2 -  Existing vision-based p edestrian dete ction techniques can be cl assified into two g roups: texture and motion based.  Tex ture based approach utilize the appearance feature th at is  extracted using Haar-wavelet (3), histogram of oriented gradients (4), and etc. Papageorgiou and Poggio(3) and Oren et al.(6) utilized the extracted Haar-wavelet feature and implemented SVM classifier to v alidate the ca ndidate region from static image frame. Munder et al. (7) described multicue (i.e. shape, texture, depth) object model within a Bayesian framework for detection and tracking based on particle filter tracking algorithm. On the other hand, motion based techniques rely on short-term motion by estimating optical flow. Viola et al. (8) presented a detection algorithm which combines motion and appearance information to build a r obust model of w alking human. Cu rio et al. (9) detected walking pedestrians in urban environment . Their initial detection process is based on a fusion of  texture anal ysis, model-based  contour features mat ching of  pedestrians,  and  inverse-perspective map ping (binocular vision) . Additionally, motion patterns of limb  movements are analyzed to classify pedestrian from other objects. The vision-based techniques can be applied many kind of vision-based sensor such as stereo and infrar ed cam era. Geismann et al. (10) employed the ste reo-camera for  p edestrian detection. The Region of Interest(ROI) is detected based on the disparity map and classified by SVM-CoHog classifier. The results of vision-based methods show promising with some extent. However, the current detection accuracy is not fully enough for implementing the pedestrian protection system in the real world. Thus, in order to improve the performance of the system, a novel approach has been proposed recently. As it ex plained in the  beginning o f the  paper, pedestrian  dete ction us ing lidar  doesn ¡¯t perform so well becaus e of its low spatia l res olution. However, laser sensor measures a distance to fo rward object with high accuracy and ra pidly, so that it shows a quite stabl e performance of objec t detection than imag e-based method. B roggi et al.(11) adapt ed the  fusion approach that lidar detec ts the obstacle and image-based method classifies the RO Is whether it is pedestrian. By adapting each merit of the lidar and visual sensor, they made the stable and highly accurate forward pedestrian detection. Similar fusion approach was also conducted by (12)(13).   II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW  A. Target of Our System  - 3 -  The ex isting methods shown in pa per (3) ~(13) ai med at fo rward ped estrian dete ction. However, over the 50% of vehicle-to-pedestrian accidents are occurring while the vehicle is turning at intersection (14), and this t ype of collisions cannot be detected with conventional forward detection. Our system targets not onl y forward but also left o r right side of the  vehicle, which is illustrated in Figure.1(b). In this case, the demanded detection environment is different in forward detection. If the vehicles drive at high speed in straight road, the system should detect the forward pedestrians in the far distance with narrow view angle. In contrast, if the vehicle turns at intersections, the system needs to detect the pedestrians walking near the vehicle with wide viewing an gle. This required viewing angle and range of the camera is the trade-off relation. Our system aims at constructing the framework to be able to select this trade-off. In the following  ex periments, our s ystem is verified with  on-board came ras of  various viewing angles which is shown in Figure.1(a).   B. Strategy Overview  Existing tex ture based t echniques have a probl em in extracting the RO Is, and the fa lse detection occurs easily because the entire image is involved. There fore, we emplo yed a motion-based method fo r object detection which focuses on the  motion difference between foreground objects and onboard background images. The detected foreground composes ROIs, which indicate the candidates of pedestrians. After the ROIs were computed, texture patterns in the ROIs were analyzed to classify pedestrians from the other objects such as polls, trees, bushes and other roa d facilities. The possible pedestrians can be  detected due to the mo tion difference compared to motions of background infrastructures such as buildings.  As our system detects ROIs based on motion difference, the pedestrians who are far away from the vehicle or stan ding near the building  sometimes might not be detec ted. However, this would not be a problem because safety assistances aren¡¯t required in this case. The detail of ROI detection and object classification is described in the next section.    III. SYSTEM DEVELPOMENT  A. Motion Baser Object Detection And Tracking  The S-T MRF model (15) is the algorithm for object tracking and detection which is quite robust to occlusion pro blems as appeare d in Fi gure.2. In (16), the model wa s applied to  pedestrian tracking at in tersection with fix ed camera. In this pap er, we adopt it for  object - 4 -  tracking with on-board camera in which the b ackground is moving irregularly. The detail of the method is explained in (17).    (a)Viewing angle (b)Accidents situation on intersection Figure.2 Results of the S-T MRF on intersection Figure.1 Target of our system  B. Geometrical Constraint on ROI  The ROIs detected by the motion-based method also contain non-pedestrian objects such as trees and  poles. In ord er to r eject su ch RO Is ra pidly, w e ad apted o bjects hei ght based  geometrical constraint to each ROIs before adapting pattern classification. Considering the     Left camera (viewing angle 100¡ã) Right camera (viewing angle 60¡ã) (a)Geometrical constraint image  (b)Relationship between ¡°D¡± [meters]  and  ¡°hp ¡°[pixels / meter] - 5 -    View angle 60¡ã View angle 100¡ã (b)Relationship between ¡±D¡±[meters] and ¡°H¡±[meters] Figure.3: Geometrical Constraint  geometrical consideration, we can calculate the distance from camera to ROI and the number of pixel in image corresponding to 1 meter in re al world coordinate, which is represented by ¡°D[meters]¡± and ¡°hp [pixel/m]¡±.  Figure.3(b) shows the relationship between these ¡°D¡± and ¡°hp¡±. When the position and the  height of ROI were obtained, the height ¡°H[m]¡± in the r eal world can be estimated using the value of ¡°hp¡±. The Figure.3(a) shows the result of adapting geometrical constraint on the real scen e image. The r ed box  is the re jected RO Is b y geometrical constraint and blue one means temporarily-accepted ROIs. As shown in Figure.3, the non-pedestrian ROIs such as a pole and a cone are rejected correctly. To be specific, we set the constraint on the height of 0.9~2.2m, which is considered as a true pedestrian. As our system is supposed to prevent the vehicle-pedestrian collision at intersections and on the straight road, which is usually located on the horizontal plane, on-board camera can be assumed to be set in horizontal position.  C. Cascade of HOG/Linear Classifiers  Every ROI that passed t he geometric constraint are processed b y classifier. We employed Fisher classifier (5) trained in HOG(Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature space. HOG feature represents spatial distribution of edge direction of the scene. As this  feature is based on brightness gradient, it is robust to the cha nge of light throughout the day. The detail is explained in (6). Although classifier based on SVM(Support Vector Machine) offers a good performance for object classification, it requires a high computational cost. After considering the practical use, the Fisher classifiers were employed for reducing the processing cost. Also, we adapted HOG of 9 dimensions ins tead of original HOG of 36 dimensions . The HOG/Fisher shows as the same as HOG/SVM while saving  the computati onal cost. F rom above results, we finall y decided to employ a Fisher in cascade classifier. In this paper, the cas cade is construc ted b y connectin g four HOG/linear classifiers. - 6 -  Figure.4(a) shows the cascade structure.

The training data for next steps were mainly extracted from the images of false true. As a pedestrian training data, we used our pedestrian imag es data base obtained fr om real roa d and the datab ase of INRIA(19). Figure.4(b)(c) shows th e examples of pedestrian and non-pedestrian images which are used for training our classifier.   IV. FEEDBACK ALGORITHM FOR ROI CORRECTION  A. Estimation of Relative Trajectory  The final step of our r esearch is to implement the pedestrian collision avoidance system on vehicle. In order to apply the assistance precisely, the system should d etect the p edestrians who are actually imminent to collision while m onitoring a number o f pedestrians walking around the vehicle. In general, pedestrians are close to vehicle whe n turning left or ri ght at intersection and collisions are occurring in particular situation. To set off warnings for every pedestrian would be annoying and makes driver felt the system useless. Therefore, the system has to mea sure the possibility of collision correctly based on r elative position between the - 7 -  vehicle and each pedestrian and warns only pedestrians who have high possibility of collision. In the process of re jecting non-pedestrian ROIs based on g eometric constraint, our s ystem estimates the distance t o pedestrian and th e an gle f rom the center ax is of camera.  By considering the  cent er of lower  boundar y of  ROI as a pedestrian p osition, the relative  trajectory to pedestrian can be  acquired. The detail of process for  estimation is descripted in  (18).     (a) Left Camera Image (b) Right Camera Image (c) Relative Trajectory Figure.6 Relative Trajectory in curve scene  The relative trajectory acquired from above process should be verified whether it is true. To do this, we  recorded the scene o f moving vehicle using two s ynchronized video cameras  (Figure.6(a)(b)) and extracted the true-considered relative trajectory based on a triangular way. Figure.6(c) is the result of our ex periment. A driver was trained to control the vehicle on particular path. If the driver controlled the vehicle exactly the same as instructed, the green relative trajectory would be acquired. The red one is the true-considered trajectory calculated from triangulation. The estimated trajectory from on-board camera was plotted as sk y-blue dots. We can see that those red and sky-blue trajectories almost accords. As the average error between two trajectories was under the 30 centimeter, we  confirmed that the accuracy of our on-board sensor is enough for real use on the pedestrian protection system.   B. ROI Correction  The S-T MRF dete cts the ROIs based on motion difference.  However, there ar e some situations that the detec ted RO I cannot cov er t he object cor rectly b y s ome reason. Such  situations affect the performance of our systems. We solved these problems by adapting The kalman filter. Figure.7 shows the algorithm of ROI Correction.  - 8 -    Figure.7 The algorithm for ROI correction  1. Kalman Filter  The Kalman Filter is wi dely used to estimate the optimized stream of d ata vector throu gh processing of measured data. The state vector satisfies (1) where ?? = [?? ?¡þ?]¡þ denotes state vector at the time k, ?¡þ? is the first derivati ve of ??, ¡þ? is the process noise with covariance matrix Q= ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ and =¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ0¡þ¡þ.  =¡þ0¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ??¡þ¡þ= ?? + ¡þ?,¡þ¡Ê??  (1)  The measurement process is described by (2)  ?? =? ?? +? ? (2)  - 9 -  where ?? is mea sured dat a vector , M= [¡þ0 ] and ?? has covariance matrix R=¡þ ?¡þ¡þ. Fomula (3)~(7) show the recursive operation of the filter.   ??¡þ¡þ,? = ??,? (3) ??¡þ¡þ,? = ??,?¡þ+ Q¡þ (4) K= ??¡þ¡þ,??¡þ????¡þ¡þ,??¡þ+? ??¡þ (5) ??¡þ¡þ,?¡þ¡þ= ??¡þ¡þ,?¡þ¡þ(¡þ¡þ??) (6) ??¡þ¡þ,?¡þ¡þ=? ?¡þ¡þ,? +? (??¡þ¡þ¡þ? ??,?) (7)  where K is  the k alman gain and ??,? is covariance matrix of ??,?. In this p aper, Kalman filter is employed for smoothing y-coordinate of top and bottom of RO I with the state vector ?? = [?_¡þ??? ?_??¡þ? ?_¡þ??? ?_??¡þ?]¡þ.  2. Boundary extension of ROI  After close observation on ROI mismatching cases, error in ROI was usually caused by rapid motion of the leg part of pedestrian. In this case, ROI only covers a upper part of body, so that system fails to classify pedestrian correctly. In addition, the error in lower boundar y of ROI also causes the error in relative trajectory, which might be critical in step on implementation  of safety system. We solve the problem by adding boundary extension using Kalman filter.  At each frame, RO I is predicted as a ??¡þ¡þ,? and corrected as a ??¡þ¡þ,?¡þ¡þ based on measured d ata   ??¡þ¡þ, which is computed fr om S-T MR F trackin g mo del. B oundary extension is triggered by comparing predicted ?_??¡þ? of ??¡þ¡þ,? with corrected ?_??¡þ? of  ??¡þ¡þ,?¡þ¡þ. If ?_??¡þ? of ??¡þ¡þ,? is shortened and the difference of two ?_??¡þ? is bigger than thresholds TH_EXT, the system classified the area  of predicted area ??¡þ¡þ,?. If the predicted area  ??¡þ¡þ,? is classified as a pedestrian, ROI tracked by S-T MRF is replaced with ??¡þ¡þ,?. In terms of extension, the revision method on the image space has the same meaning with that of the re al world. However , the latter method needs another cal culation on the re al world. After considering the processing cost, we decided to adapt the former method.  3. Further Segmentation of ROI  If objects such as road side poles, cones, o r trees exist behind or in fr ont of pedestrians on the on-board image, the S -T MRF consider pedestrians and these roa d side fa cilities as a single object because m otion difference of two objects are mixed. This re sults in ex panded ROIs that include a lot  of back ground area. Those RO Is are somet imes re jected b y a - 10 -  geometrical constraint even though the ROI includes a real pedestrian in it. Such cases usually occur over a long frame, and increase the number of missing alarm. To solve the problem, we programmed our system to do the further segmentation on the ROIs. The detail of algorithm is described on the right page of the Figure.7. The process is almost same with that of further segmentation, but as  a variable for trigger, ?_¡þ??? an d TH_FURSEG was used instead of ?_??¡þ? and TH_EXT. Also, i n addition to classific ation of predicted ??¡þ¡þ,?, motion  difference of ??¡þ¡þ,? is also considered for reducing false positive of ROI Correction. This is because the road side pole, cones and trees have very slight motion difference compared with that of pedestrians. Ther efore if the motion dif ference is lower than TH_MOTION, further segmentation of ROI is not triggered. All thresholds used in ROI Correction were decided by statistical approach. Figure.8 shows the ex ample of decreasing the mis sing alarm b y this further segmentation algorithm. The blue box  means the pedestri an-classified ROI and red one is the rejected ROI.   V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  In this paper, the center camera is supposed to  be used for avoiding the front collisions to pedestrians while driving at high speed along the straight road. Therefore, we employed the camera of narrow viewing angles (20¡ãand 30¡ã) for forward pedestrian detection. On the other hand, the left and rig ht cameras are supposed to be used for  preventing the side collisions to pedestrians at inters ections while the vehicle t urning left or ri ght at r elatively low sp eed. Therefore, the came ra of wide viewing  an gles ( 60¡ã, 70¡ã, and 100¡ã)  are  adapted for left-forward and right-forward detection. In this paper, 27 sc enes including 218 pedestrians were examined) for  ev aluating the p erformance of pedestrian det ection. Those video sequences are acquired while driving on the real roads in the do wntown of Tokyo. Training data set shown in Figure.4 was collected from another scene set that has no mutual scene with above 27 scenes which was used for evaluation.   Table.2 shows the final results of our system. ¡°Ground truth¡± represents the total number of frames in which pedestrians exist. The number o f frames is c ounted for each pedestrian and ¡°Ground Truth¡± is calculated by summing all the numbers of frames, which is counted from each pedestrian. For example, there exist two pe destrians on one scen e. The one pedestrian shows up for  10 fr ames and the other ex ists only for 8 frames. In this case, the value o f ¡°Ground Truth¡± should be estimated as 18. ¡°Correct alarm¡± represents the number of frames in which pedestrians can be detec ted correctly. Therefore, ¡°FalseNegative_Rate¡± represents the rate of pedestrians that our algorithm failed in detection. ¡°The number of Alarm¡± is the number of frames at which the algorithm determined the ROI as a pedestrian, and the number - 11 -  of frames is estimated by  each possible pedestrian. ¡°False Alarm¡± r epresents the number of  frames at which the algorithm determined the ROI as a pedestrian even though the region is not a pedestrian. Therefore, ¡°FalseAlarm_Rate¡± is the rate of false detection.   Table.2: Results of our method Feedback algorithm Ground Truth The Number of Alarm Correct Alarm False Alarm None 5913 5823 5483 (FNR = 7.27%) 340 (FAR = 5.84%) Enabled 5913 6006 5711 (FNR = 3.42%) 355 (FAR = 5.91%)  I want you to note that ¡°FalseAlarm_Rate¡± is different from ¡°FalsePositive_Rate¡± as usually said. Our video set for evaluation contains a number of non -pedestrian objec ts so that counting all objects is likely to be arbitrary and impossible. In that case, ¡°FalsePositive_Rate¡± is significantly decreasing and mi ght be useless. Therefore we adapted ¡°FalseAlarm_Rate¡±, which has the numb er of dete cted objec t as a denominato r. In T able.2 ¡°FNR¡± mea ns ¡°FalseNegative_Rate¡±, an d ¡°FAR¡± mea ns ¡°FalseAlarm_Rate¡±. The final re sults with and without feedback algorithm shown in section  can be found in Table.2. False negative rate is dramatically decreased when we used our feedback algorithm. Some examples of pedestrian detection are showed on Figure. 9. The bo xes on the scene images represent the ROIs, which are being tracked by the S-T MRF. The blue one means the pedestrian-classified objec ts, and red one is the objec ts which is determined as a non-pedestrian by the HOG/linear classifier. The numbers on the box es represent the object numbers, and the relative trajectories of each object are appeared on Figure. 10.   VI. CONCLUSION  In this paper , w e have  developed the g eneral method for pedestrian d etection which is  applicable to the camera with the various kinds of view angle, from 20 to 100 deg rees, and achieved the high accuracy in pedestrian detection. In addition, this algorithm only requires a quite simple and practical calibration for camera based on the experiment of pedestrian height. Thus, practical s ystems can be desi gned by selecting the camera viewin g angles suitable to  the systems while the al gorithm for pedestrian detection can be uniforml y adapted. We also confirmed that the accuracy of estimating the relative trajectory is quite enough for real use in - 12 -  on-board p edestrian pro tection s ystem. The effect of th e vehi cle rolli ng motion on the accuracy of relative trajectory seems not to be so influential. However, depending on the road condition or driving status of acceleration or steering, it might become unignorable. Therefore, as our future work,  we plan to modify our system to absorb those ef fects using the internal vehicle information from Controller Area Network(CAN).

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) contracted the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to perform Phase III of the Enhanced Rear Signaling (ERS) for Heavy Trucks project which was directed at investigating methods to reduce or mitigate those crashes where a heavy truck has been struck from behind by another vehicle. The focus of this paper is to discuss the dynamic evaluation of the final ERS countermeasure system on the public roadways of Virginia. Results indicated the system was robust in real-world driving situations. The system performed well at detecting -2- rear-end crash threats, activating a trailer-positioned warning-light system, drawing the gazes of distracted following-vehicle drivers back to the forward roadway, and resulted in minor following-vehicle unintended consequences. An increase in false alarm rate was found for the warning light activation system during low-speed, high-traffic-density scenarios and the propensity of these false alarms should be addressed prior to a Field Operational Test (FOT).  Key Words: Heavy Truck, Rear-end Crash, Crash Countermeasure  INTRODUCTION Driver distraction¡¯s contributing role in crashes has been a critical issue in transportation safety research. At the forefront has been recent and compelling naturalistic driving research providing evidence of an increased crash risk due to visual distraction (2,3). These studies have found that drivers of light vehicles and heavy trucks having long eyes-off-road glances were more likely to have been involved in crashes. Of the 3,876,000 total vehicle-to-vehicle crashes in 2008, rear-end collisions consisted of approximately 30 percent (4). In 2008, heavy trucks were found to be 3.2 times more likely than other vehicles to be struck from behind in two-vehicle fatal crashes (1). This particular collision type results in higher-than-usual rates of fatalities and injuries compared to rear-end accidents in which the lead vehicle is a light vehicle. According to the 2006 General Estimates System (GES) database, heavy trucks were involved in approximately 23,500 of the rear-end collisions that occurred which resulted in 135 fatalities and 1603 incapacitating injuries (5). To address this serious issue, FMCSA developed the ERS for Heavy Trucks project which was directed at investigating methods to reduce or mitigate those crashes where a heavy truck has been struck from behind by another vehicle. Prior to the current effort, two phases of work had been completed on the project. Phase I entailed a crash data analysis to determine causal factors of these crashes and the identification of potential countermeasures to aid in reducing them (6). Phase II entailed the development of a prototype system that incorporated countermeasures from Phase I (7). Phase II revealed what appeared to be the potential benefits of using such countermeasures. VTTI was contracted to perform Phase III. The main purpose of Phase III was to explore the benefits of rear-end crash countermeasures and to plan for a large scale FOT of a final ERS countermeasure system.   For many years VTTI has been involved in light-vehicle rear-lighting research directed at the prevention of rear-end crashes (8,9). The results of that research were used to aid in the design of the current project for heavy trucks. Most previous work on prevention of rear-end crashes has been directed toward attention-getting and eye-drawing; that is, trying to get the following-vehicle driver to look forward at the vehicle ahead instead of continuing to look -3- away. The most recent work carried out by VTTI, sponsored by the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA), involved conversion of incandescent light-vehicle enhanced rear lighting to light-emitting diode (LED) technology (9). The results clearly showed that one LED unit had the highest on-axis output, a very narrow beam-width, and if the units were ganged they could compete successfully with incandescent units in terms of on-axis light output. This previous work suggested that for heavy trucks, lighting similar to that developed for light vehicles should be used; namely, multiple high-output LED units that flash simultaneously at a 5-Hz frequency. However, the LED unit configurations and positioning on the rear of the vehicle were revisited and tested in the current project both in static and dynamic experiments performed on the Virginia Smart Road (2.2 mile long closed test-track) using light-vehicle drivers (volunteers) (5). The result of those experiments was an ERS countermeasure system made up of a 12 LED-unit warning-light configuration combined with a radar-based closed-loop activation system. This ERS countermeasure system was selected for its eye-drawing performance capabilities and positive driver acceptance ratings. The focus of this paper is to discuss the final field evaluation of the final ERS countermeasure system on the public roadways of Virginia.  METHOD There were three main areas of investigation during this dynamic evaluation of the ERS countermeasure system. The first area of investigation was in regard to the presence or absence of following-vehicle unintended consequences during warning-light activation. For example, an unintended consequence in this situation might include a following-vehicle driver dangerously swerving after the activation of the heavy truck rear warning-lights. The second area of investigation was the performance of the rear warning-light radar-based closed-loop activation system. A closed-loop activation system includes the measurement of closing rate (velocity) and closing distance to the following vehicle, along with lead-vehicle velocity and deceleration, regardless of speed and distance between vehicles. The third and final area of investigation was the eye-drawing capability of the rear warning-lights. Although the eye-drawing capability of the final warning-light configuration had been established earlier in the project in static and dynamic tests, assessing eye-drawing in the final field evaluation was still attempted (5).   Study Design Because this was an observational study, no drivers were recruited to participate. Rather, a class 8 combination unit truck (CUT) with a 53 ft (16.15 m) trailer equipped with the ERS countermeasure system joined other vehicles in the available traffic stream and observed -4- vehicle-following situations. Approval for this observational study was given by the Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board Human Assurances Committee.  Data were collected during the day in fair weather. Two rear-lighting configurations were tested. The first rear-lighting configuration consisted of the normal pre-installed trailer brake lights (Baseline) and the second was a rear warning-light configuration consisting of 12 LED units positioned on the trailer main bumper (Warning Lights) (figure 1). Also tested was a radar-based closed-loop activation system.   Rear Warning-lights (Warning Lights)Normal Brake Lights (Baseline) Figure 1. Rear-lighting Configurations Used During Field Evaluation of the ERS Countermeasure System.  The presence or absence of following-vehicle unintended consequences during manual rear-lighting activation was investigated and served as the main dependent variable (DV). Manual rear-lighting activations were limited to driving scenarios that were deemed safe by the lead experimenter and when the experimental CUT was traveling at a constant forward speed. Unintended consequences resulting from activation of the Warning Lights configuration were determined through a combination of video and sensor data collected from a Data Acquisition System (DAS) and compared to typical Baseline braking events. There were two categories of interest for investigation with regard to roadway type. The first roadway type investigated was a Single-lane Roadway (one lane in each direction). In this category, a following vehicle had no lane option other than following directly behind the experimental CUT in the same lane. The second roadway type investigated was a Multi-lane Roadway (at least two lanes available in the same direction of travel and one or more lanes in the opposite direction). In this category, a following vehicle had the option to follow the experimental CUT in the same lane or in an -5- adjacent lane (to the left or the right depending on the experimental CUT¡¯s lane position). The main independent variables (IVs) for the Single-lane Roadway category were rear lighting (Baseline, Warning Lights) and following-vehicle distance (Close [d < 100 ft (30.48 m)], Distant [100 ft (30.48 m) < d < 175 ft (53.34 m)]). The main IVs for the Multi-lane Roadway category were identical with the addition of following-vehicle lane position (Same, Right, Left).   A signal detection theory experimental design was used to evaluate the closed-loop activation system performance (10). During pilot tests, it was determined there were three categories of roadway type in need of investigation. The first roadway type tested was an Interstate Highway (i.e., Interstate 81 with 65 mi/h [104.61 km/h] speed limit). The second roadway type tested was a State Highway (i.e., Virginia Highway 460 with 45-55 mi/h [72.42-88.51 km/h] speed limit). The third roadway type tested included all other lower-speed roadways consisting of rural and town roads, with traffic lights consisting of both single-lane and multi-lane roadways (25-45 mi/h [40.23-72.42 km/h] speed limit). This third roadway type was categorized as Other. Four occurrences of detection were categorized: 1) correct detections, 2) missed detections, 3) false alarms, and 4) correct non-detections. The performance objective of the closed-loop activation system was to maximize the probabilities of occurrence of correct detections and correct non-detections, and minimize the probabilities of occurrence of missed detections and false alarms. The main DV was rear warning-light activation (Yes or No). The main IV was following-vehicle lane position (Same, Right, Left).  The third area of investigation was the eye-drawing capability of the Warning Lights configuration as compared to Baseline. The experimental paradigm used was for the experimenter to monitor following-vehicle drivers¡¯ head position and eye gaze in real time by way of rearward-mounted cameras installed on the rear of the trailer of the experimental CUT. When a following-vehicle driver glanced away from the forward roadway, the experimenter would activate a rear-lighting configuration. The time taken for a participant to redirect his/her gaze originating away from the forward roadway back to the forward roadway was measured and served as the main DV (Time To Look-up). The use of a between-subjects design was used.  Apparatus As previously mentioned, two rear-lighting configurations were positioned on the rear of the experimental CUT (Baseline, Warning Lights) (as previously shown in figure 1). All three areas of investigation relied heavily on video data. Four cameras of a single type were selected and positioned on the rear of the trailer. The camera type selected was a high-resolution color module camera designed for indoor use. Four different lenses were selected, each with a different focal length, to maximize the head position and eye-gaze identification of following-vehicle drivers. A single camera housing mounted on the rear of the trailer was built -6- to hold the four cameras. The camera housing was built to be as small and inconspicuous as possible (figure 2). Rear-lighting activation was controlled by the experimenter in the experimental CUT sleeper berth. Upon activation of the Warning Lights configuration, lights would flash simultaneously at a 5-Hz frequency for a period of 5 s. Upon activation of the Baseline configuration, steady brake lighting (no simultaneous flashing) was initiated for a period of 5 s. The four camera views used for determining following-vehicle lane position and following-vehicle driver head position and eye-gaze were recorded in a single video view (figure 2). A rear-mounted radar was used for determining following-vehicle distances and closing rate information. The closed-loop activation system utilized collision avoidance algorithms originally developed in light-vehicle rear-lighting research and were modified for use with heavy trucks (5).   Figure 2. Camera Housing Position and Screenshot of Following-vehicle Driver Display.  Procedure The experimental CUT joined other vehicles in the available traffic stream on multiple roadway types and observed vehicle-following situations. Two experimenters were located in the experimental CUT: one to drive the truck, and the second to manually trigger the two rear-lighting configurations. Moreover, manual activations of rear lighting were not tied to actual experimental CUT decelerations; this allowed the eye-drawing power of the rear lighting to be captured without the risk of hard-braking events.   The experimental CUT joined the traffic stream on two roadway types for the investigation of following-vehicle unintended consequences (Single-lane and Multi-lane Roadways). The assigned rear-lighting condition was activated when following vehicles were positioned in one of the previously defined lane positions and associated following distances. A data reduction effort was performed on each rear-lighting activation event. Further details on the reduction and -7- analysis performed for following-vehicle unintended consequences are presented in the associated results section to follow.  Three primary road types were used for the closed-loop activation system testing (Interstate Highway, State Highway, and Other). The experimental CUT joined the traffic stream with the closed-loop activation system fully functional with no experimenter input provided. A data reduction effort was performed for each following-vehicle scenario. The primary goal of the data reduction effort was to appropriately assign each event that occurred into one of the signal detection theory experimental design categories. Further details on the reduction and analysis performed are presented in the associated results section to follow.  Eye-drawing capability of the Warning Lights configuration was investigated using a methodology similar to that used in previous dynamic testing on the Virginia Smart Road (5). Using multiple rearward camera views, the experimenter monitored the following-vehicle drivers¡¯ head position and eye-gaze in the same lane directly behind the experimental CUT. When a following-vehicle driver glanced away from the forward roadway, the lead experimenter would activate the assigned rear-lighting configuration. Video data for each event were later reduced in order to determine the Time To Look-up for each event.   RESULTS Following-vehicle Unintended Consequences For an event to be considered an unintended consequence in the Single-lane Roadway category the following vehicle had to be positioned in the same lane directly behind the heavy truck as well as accelerate, swerve, deviate the lane, perform a heavy deceleration (brake lockup), or any combination of within 5 s after rear-lighting activation. For an event to be considered an unintended consequence in the Multi-lane Roadway category, a following vehicle had to accelerate, swerve, deviate the lane, initiate a lane change, perform a heavy deceleration (brake lock-up), or any combination of within 5 s after rear-lighting activation (light to moderate deceleration was considered during following-vehicle adjacent lane positions). It is important to note that following-vehicle normal deceleration behavior (light to moderate deceleration) was not considered an unintended consequence when the following-vehicle was positioned in the same lane directly behind the experimental CUT. It was determined that normal following-vehicle deceleration in the same lane would be considered normal light to moderate deceleration during actual lead-vehicle braking and/or rear warning-light activity in a real-world driving environment. Accelerations and decelerations were determined by calculating the mean closing rate of the following vehicle during the 5 s prior to light activation -8- and comparing to the 5 s immediately following light activation. If the difference between values was greater than or equal to 5 ft/s (1.52 m/s), then the event was labeled as an acceleration or deceleration. The value of 5 ft/s (1.52 m/s) is the equivalent to 3.41 mi/h (5.49 km/h). Also, if the following vehicle was not closing on the heavy truck for the 5 s prior to light activation, but was found to be closing on the heavy truck for the 5 s immediately following light activation, the event was labeled as an acceleration (even if the difference between mean closing rate values was less than 5 ft/s (1.52 m/s). Similarly, if the following vehicle was closing on the heavy truck for the 5 s prior to light activation, but was not found to be closing on the heavy truck for the 5 s immediately following light activation, the event was labeled as a deceleration. The frequencies and types of following-vehicle unintended consequences are shown in table 1. A Fisher¡¯s Exact Test was performed for each rear-lighting comparison where applicable.

Frequencies and Types of Unintended Consequences by Roadway Category.  Closed-loop Activation System The closed-loop activation system was tested on three different roadway types (Interstate Highway, State Highway, Other). As previously mentioned, a signal detection theory experimental design was used to evaluate the closed-loop activation system performance (10). Four occurrences of detection were categorized: 1) correct detections, 2) missed detections, 3) false alarms, and 4) correct non-detections. The main DV was light activation (Yes or No). The main IV was following-vehicle lane position (Same, Right, Left). An event for following -9- vehicles positioned in the Same lane directly behind the experimental CUT was defined as a following vehicle approaching (reducing following distance) the rear of the experimental CUT, or maintaining a set following distance (hovering). An event for following vehicles positioned in one of the two adjacent lanes was defined as a following vehicle attempting to overtake the experimental CUT (passing), or maintaining a set following distance (hovering). Each event consisted of at least one vehicle within 150 ft (45.72 m) of the rear of the experimental heavy truck. Results are presented below in table 2.

Activation System Performance by Roadway Type.  Eye-drawing Capability The third area of investigation was the eye-drawing capability of the Warning Lights configuration in comparison to Baseline. Time To Look-up served as the main DV. A one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Although not statistically significant, results demonstrated a positive trend with F(1,46) = 2.26, p = 0.1392. The mean Time To Look-up results are shown in figure 3.   0.70 0.58012345Baseline Main BumperMean Time to Look-UpLighting Configurationn=24n=24 Figure 3. Mean Time To Look-up as a Function of Lighting Configuration. -10-  The figure shows that, on average, participants receiving the Warning Lights took less Time To Look-up to the forward roadway than did participants receiving the Baseline configuration (although this was not a statistically significant difference, this may have resulted from insufficient statistical power).  Summary and Conclusions The occurrences of following-vehicle unintended consequences during both Baseline and Warning Lights activation were few. The only statistically significant difference found indicated a higher occurrence of unintended consequences for Baseline, all of which were minor accelerations. Upon further investigation of these specific unintended consequences, it was found that two of the five occurred on State Highway entrance ramps. This could indicate that acceleration still may be acceptable in this scenario as long as the vehicle still maintains a safe distance behind the experimental CUT. Of the unintended consequences that did occur across all roadway categories, all were labeled as decelerations and accelerations (for example no swerves, lane deviations, lane changes, or heavy decelerations were found). Overall, the results indicated that although the Warning Lights configuration could be seen from adjacent lanes, warning-light activation did not contribute to unsafe following-vehicle driver reactions/behaviors as compared to the baseline brake lighting.  Results indicated that the closed-loop activation system performed well at rear-end crash detection and rear warning-light activation. In all three roadway types, the closed-loop activation system performed with a 100-percent correct detection rate (zero missed detections) indicating excellent performance in rear-end collision-threat scenarios. For the Interstate Highway and State Highway roadway conditions, the closed-loop activation system had a low false alarm rate in non-rear-end collision-threat scenarios. For the Other roadway category, the false alarm rate increased substantially, specifically during following-vehicle adjacent lane approaches. This increase in the false alarm rate led researchers to further investigate the video and radar data collected for each scenario. It was found that a majority of the false alarms occurred when there was more than one following vehicle within 200 ft (60.96 m) of the rear of the experimental CUT (46 of the 51 false alarms). This indicated that the radar primary target identification firmware may need refinement for lower speed, high-traffic-density scenarios before implementation in an FOT.   The research team was able to develop a rearward camera system that was successful at identifying head position and eye-gaze up to a maximum of 115 ft (35.05 m) behind the experimental CUT. A total of 48 events were captured (24 Baseline, 24 Warning Lights). Results found were similar to static and dynamic testing performed earlier in the project in that -11- a reduction in Time To Look-up was found for the Warning Lights (near statistical significance) (5). The mean Time To Look-up values did show an observed practical difference and benefit. Converting the mean Time To Look-up values (0.579 s for main bumper and 0.7 s for baseline brake lights) to distance traveled at 55 mi/h (88.51 km/h) equates to 46.72 ft (14.24 m) and 56.47 ft (17.21 m), respectively.  Therefore, drivers, on average, were traveling approximately 10 ft (3.05 m) further without looking at the roadway when exposed to the Baseline brake light condition as compared to the Warning Lights configuration. The additional 10 ft  (3.05 m) afforded by the main bumper rear warning-light configuration may reduce the occurrence, and/or crash severity, of rear-end crashes by providing additional time and distance needed for the following-vehicle to get stopped. The consistent reduction in Time To Look-up for the Warning Lights configuration over that of the Baseline brake lights for all experiments conducted in the project shows that a strong rear warning-light candidate has been selected and is ready for implementation in an FOT (5).  DISCUSSION Overall, the ERS countermeasure system was robust in real-world driving situations. Results indicated that the system performed well at detecting and signaling rear-end crash threats, drawing the gazes of following-vehicle drivers back to the forward roadway, and resulted in few following-vehicle unintended consequences during fair weather and daylight hours. Although the analysis of eye-drawing capability was not statistically significant, the mean differences in duration were in the same direction as previous eye-drawing capability experiments in the project. A limitation was found during closed-loop activation system testing at lower speeds in high-traffic-density scenarios due to radar target identification problems, thus producing a higher rate of false alarms in comparison to other roadway types. The propensity of these false alarms should be addressed prior to an FOT. Also, the current study¡¯s testing included only real-world data collection during daylight hours and in fair weather (no rain or fog). Future work may be required to investigate the potential need for rear warning-light brightness adjustments for adverse weather and lower-light conditions.

 1  BAYESIAN-MONTE CARLO MODEL FOR COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM DESIGN OF COGNITIVE CONNECTED VEHICLE  Ata M. Khan Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering Carleton University Ottawa, Ontario  K1S5B6  CANADA Telephone: +613 520 2600 (EXT 5786), Fax: +613 520 3951 Email: ata_khan@carleton.ca  ABSTRACT Cognitive connected vehicles will require a number of essential features, including collision avoidance advice and adaptive longitudinal control. Their design should integrate intelligent technology and human factors. This paper describes a self-calibrating adaptive model for aiding the design of a warning system for preventing rear and side swipe collisions. The cognitive vehicle is expected to have the capability of information on location and distance between vehicles obtained on-line. In off-line research, such information is obtainable from off-line simulation devices. The location and distance information is used in association with a Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian decision model to identify pre-crash condition. Here, the case of human control is covered and the system provides advice for avoiding rear or side swipe accidents while minimizing false alarms. The model structure and algorithm are presented and an illustrative example of a distracted driver is provided. The crash warning system is mainly intended for on-line use in actual driving conditions. Also, it can be used in driving simulators for off-line safety and traffic flow studies in association with microsimulators of traffic. Key Topics: 7(b) Vehicle warning and control systems, 7(a) Driver assistance  Key Words: Collision avoidance, cognitive vehicle, connected vehicle, vehicle warning,   Bayesian, Monte Carlo, safety Paper Type: Scientific Region: North America    INTRODUCTION  Statistics show that a high proportion of accidents in traffic networks are rear crash type. Also, side swipe accidents caused by unsafe lane change, lane departure, and merge actions are noted to be cause for concern. These safety problems are expected to become worse, given the increased trend of in-vehicle devices with potential for creating driver distraction. There is increasing interest in in-vehicle components of intelligent transportation systems (e.g., a navigation system). However, there are concerns that under complex and demanding driving conditions, these could be the source of driver distraction and might further contribute to rear and side swipe collisions. For this reason, safety effect of new technologies is of growing interest in  2 OECD countries and elsewhere around the world and calls have been made for driver assistance technologies (1,2, 3).  Future vehicles are expected to have the capability of safe and efficient operations whether these are under human control or in the adaptive longitudinal control mode of operation. Further, the capability to operate in connected traffic environment is also desirable. These requirements can be met with cognitive vehicle design features (4,5,6). Specifically, in order to address the rear and sideswipe collision concerns, reliable collision warning systems are required (1). For assisting drivers in maintaining safe distances between vehicles, crash prevention systems are receiving increased attention. However, their design is highly influenced by the capability of technology and less by human factors.  The safety research community has expressed concerns about the sub-optimal alert issue (6,7,8). In the case of a related system, in the design of the adaptive cruise control, there is a need to reduce abrupt episodes of accelerations and decelerations. This paper describes a model that can be used as the basis for improving the design of a crash warning system. A related model developed by the author is intended for the longitudinal control of a cognitive vehicle in order to enhance safety, reduce abrupt episodes of deceleration and acceleration for improving driving comfort and efficiency, and minimizing environmental effects. In this paper, only the human control case is covered.        TECHNOLOGICAL AND HUMAN FACTORS IN COGNITIVE VEHICLE DESIGN  Various research groups have expressed views on the attributes of the cognitive vehicle (4,5,6). In arriving at the views that are advanced here, current and recent developments in communication technology and the use of artificial intelligence in vehicle design have been taken into account. A cognitive vehicle is expected to have attributes that are noted in Table 1. Also, shown in this table are the features that are necessary for the design of the crash warning system. It is assumed that in the human control mode of operating the cognitive vehicle, the control of the vehicle remains with the driver. That is, it is up to the driver to act upon the warning received and that active safety features are not automatically deployed.  Table 1. Cognitive vehicle features for human control Cognitive vehicle features Features for human control Awareness of position and surroundings X Ability to gather data and send out data X Ability to process data X Ability to cooperate/collaborate X Communication for active safety  Informs the driver about situations (warnings, advice) X Diagnostic capability X In case of crash, capability to send and receive information X Ability to provide non-distractive user interface X Infotainment capability     3 To further elaborate on the cognitive vehicle features that are required for the design of an effective crash warning system, the following requirements should be met.  Information availability on the complete situational context (consisting of vehicle, environment and driver) is necessary and is within reach.  In designing systems for the cognitive vehicle, the technology and methodology should be able to deliver the capabilities of context awareness, adaptive interfaces, driver intention recognition, and driver monitoring (6).        Ability to measure distance between vehicles on a real time basis and to define critical distance under the dynamic driving, road and environmental conditions.  Self calibration capability (i.e., updating the probability of the driver to perceive the correct distance between vehicles vis-¨¤-vis the safe stopping distance in case of an emergency), monitoring driver attention or distraction on the basis of corrective actions taken (or not taken).  Deciding when to issue alert and the nature of alert.  Early research in support of designing crash avoidance systems advanced the state of knowledge in describing driver performance in situations that could potentially lead to a rear crash. For example see reference 9. Initial attempts at the development of driver alert systems were of deterministic in nature, but these studies advanced the understanding of rear crash prevention and driver performance (9). Also, the evolutionary nature of the theoretical models, hardware and software has constrained the identification of the combination of ¡°safety critical¡± distance between vehicles and the timing of collision warning to be given to drivers. Further, distraction and aggressiveness in driving could not be modelled for the purpose of designing collision warning systems.      Given the complexities of the human-machine interface, it is not enough to treat alert and distracted drivers alike and simply rely on distance measuring technology for warning drivers of decreasing distance between vehicles. An attentive driver may well be aware of the situation and probably has already taken corrective action. Providing a "red alert" in all such cases may give the impression of a false alarm. On the other hand, even a non-aggressive driver may sometime be driving in a distracted environment and therefore may not be aware that the vehicle is rapidly approaching the leading vehicle. The issue of the so-called nuisance alarms and a reduced system acceptance by the user is well documented (6,10).  Progress has been made in developing technology that can alert the driver if there is potential for a rear crash. However, many researchers have pointed out that their performance needs to be improved in terms of reliability and optimal time for providing the alert messages. According to the European research efforts, the driver warning systems should analyse driver intention information (i.e., actions) in order to establish if premature warnings should be suppressed (6). Likewise, research carried out for the US Department of Transportation has stressed the importance of formally incorporating driver¡¯s intention by obtaining additional information on driver action or lack of action (e.g., intent to change lane, lane change start) (8).     The model advanced in this paper goes a step beyond existing work by developing a realistic probabilistic method for the identification of the optimal driver alert message as well as the timing of providing this message. This is an attempt to address the deficiencies that have been  4 noted above. The driver monitoring part of the system has the capability to recognize driver intention. Also, the self-calibrating and adaptive features are addressing the weaknesses of existing or proposed systems. The algorithm described in this paper is probabilistic (as opposed to deterministic) and uses Bayesian artificial intelligence methods (11). It is supported by the technology of cognitive connected vehicle and has the capability to analyze the driver intention information for suppressing premature warnings without compromising safety.                     CRASH AVOIDANCE SYSTEM DESIGN  Figure 1 shows the major functions of the crash warning system. Although the system has the capability to handle the side-swipe collision case, due to space limitation, only the rear crash case is covered in this paper. For on-line as well as real-time driving simulator applications, the location and distance estimation capability is required. For off-line application, the driving simulator and the car-following part of traffic microsimulator provide distance data. The user manual of a stochastic microsimulator of traffic provides a description of the car-following model that is imbedded in the software. For a general description of the functions of a car-following model, please see reference 12.                      SAFETY MARGIN AND DRIVER ACTION MONITOR   During the driving mission, the system has to estimate the critical distance (dc) for emergency stopping. This applies in the longitudinal direction under the car-following environment. Likewise, in the transverse direction, the safe distance between the envelopes of vehicles has to be known. These distances have to be compared all the time with the available distances. A                                                                                                                                                          Figure 1.

At any time, the system is able to estimate critical distance (dc) required between vehicles for avoiding a crash and the available distance. In order to account for uncertainties in a dynamic traffic environment, a normal probability density function and applicable standard deviations of the mean values of these distances can be specified as inputs to the Monte Carlo simulation model. In turn, the simulator estimates the mean value of the safety margin, its standard deviation, and the probability of safety margin > 0.  If a distracted or an aggressive driver approaches the threshold critical distance dc, the system is designed to issue a red alert. In order to guarantee safety, dc is set to be higher than distance required for emergency stopping in case the leading vehicle stops abruptly or a stopped vehicle or a stationary object is encountered. The road condition, vehicle speed (affected by traffic, weather, and geometric design of the road), and other driving environmental factors are used as a basis for setting the critical distance dc.         For establishing other distance thresholds for issuing alerts, d1.25c and d1.5c are defined and the Monte Carlo simulation model estimates the mean safety margins, their standard deviations and probabilities of safety margins to be higher than zero. For a freeway driving example, Figure 2 shows P(safety margin>0) for selected distances to the leading vehicle. The information presented in Figure 2 suggests that at dc, if a distracted driver ignores a red alert warning and does not immediately decelerate to increase distance to the leading vehicle, there is approximately 0.5 probability of a rear collision. In order to increase the probability of safety margin, the designer can increase dc. In the example case, standard deviations of distance required vs. distance available were set at 15% of the mean values.   The algorithm described next is used for the identification of optimal driver alerts. These are the timing of crash warning (i.e., immediate or wait to learn about driver intent) and the nature of alert message (e.g., no alert message, amber alert, red alert).     Figure 2. Probability of safety margin (freeway driving example)  6 ALGORITHM  INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS The algorithm for crash warning system is shown in Figure 3. The system implemented by the algorithm integrates the cognitive vehicle¡¯s location and distance estimation module, the Monte Carlo simulator and the Bayesian statistical method. See reference 11 for an introduction to Bayesian statistical decision analysis. The algorithm implements the crash warning system in real time.  In the rear collision warning case, a check is made on distance between the subject vehicle and the leading vehicle. If the distance is less than or equal to 1.5 times the critical distance headway, the algorithm launches the Bayesian decision analysis. A brief description of the steps as well as an example application is provided below. For the sequence of steps, please see Figure 3.

The number of states as well as the 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 multipliers can be changed by the designer.  The system has the following alert message options:  a0  No alert massage is required  aA  Amber alert message implies deceleration so as to increase distance to the target d1.5c state.   aR Red alert message requires emergency braking in order to avoid a crash and to increase distance to achieve d1.5c if the lead vehicle is mobile. If the lead vehicle is stationary or if the warning was given in order to avoid collision with a stationary object, the driver will be able to stop the vehicle without a collision.    Timing options for the driver alert are:  e0 (early applicable warning issued on the basis of initial information)  ew (the waiting mode so as to acquire and analyze additional information on the dynamics of vehicle-following and then issue the appropriate warning, if applicable)  Possible readings on the driver¡¯s correct perception of distance are as follows:  r0 (no new reading, if e0 is selected),  rc (corresponds to dc), r1.25c (corresponds to d1.25c), and r1.5c (corresponds to d1.5c).  Prior probabilities of driving states, P¡¯(d), can be computed by the imbedded logic of the system design. These are assigned on the basis of a check on the location of the vehicle in association with the automated calibration feature of the Bayesian method described in the following section of the paper. Alternatively, these can be assigned subjectively by the designer.  Driver reliability of perceiving distance is expressed as P(r|d,e), the conditional probability, which serves the function of monitoring driver performance. That is, given a distance d, the probability that the driver will perceive it accordingly (i.e., r). If the driver is fully attentive and has excellent perception-reaction characteristics, the driver reliability would be high.  In the context of the present model, if the driver can maintain the target distance, the conditional probability P(rc|dc) will be high. If the driver is distracted, and/or has relatively poor perception-reaction attributes, driver reliability would be low. In the self-calibrating mode, this probability is computed on the basis of driver performance. On the other hand, in spite of decreasing distance to the lead vehicle (or a fixed object), if the driver does not take corrective action, the P(rc|dc,e) will become small. The same pattern applies to other combinations of r and d. As an alternative to the self-calibrating function, the conditional probabilities can be assigned by the designer on the basis of driving simulator studies.   8 DISTRACTED DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY   MODELLING DISTRACTION AND AGGRESSION IN DRIVING Here, the non-aggressive driving case is modelled and therefore, the driver¡¯s target is to maintain a safe d1.5c distance. On other hand, if the driver becomes distracted, a self-calibrating function used for estimating the conditional probability P(r|d,e) takes into account this mode of driving behaviour in the identification of optimal e & a combination.  In the use of the Bayesian model, the following methodology can be used to obtain priors. P¡¯(di) = ui/¡Æui  and  ui = 1/[¡þdi+k], where ¡þdi is distance away from d1.5c and k is a self-calibrating constant. Since the driver is attempting to maintain d1.5c distance, the following priors are computed. P¡¯(d1.5c)=0.7, P¡¯(d1.25c)=0.2, P¡¯(dc)=0.1. The P(d1.5c) of 0.7 is an approximation of probability obtained from the standard normal density function by using a standard normal deviate of 1. The remaining 0.3 probability is allocated on the basis of distance from d1.5c as noted above. The sum of priors is equal to 1.0.  The following is the formulation for the self-calibrating function that leads to P(r|d,e). Using the index i for r|d: Pi=ui/¡Æui ui = 1/[¡þdi + k] where ¡þdi is the distance away from the target safe distance of d1.5c and  k is a calibration constant that reflects driver distraction.  If the vehicle moves closer to the leading vehicle and therefore the d1.5c is no longer available, k is automatically modified as noted below. k adjustment when the driver is at d1.25c = e[k used(d1.5c/d1.25c)]   k adjustment when the driver is at d1.0c = e[k used(d1.5c/dc)]  For non-aggressive but distracted driving on the freeway, the conditional probabilities shown in Table 2 were computed. These reflect the driving condition that at d1.5c, the driver is alert, given that it is the target distance that a non-aggressive driver wishes to maintain. However, due to distraction, the driver moves closer to the leading vehicle and this phenomenon is reflected by the lower values of P(r1.25c|d1.25c) and P(r1c|d1c).        Table 2. Conditional probabilities (distracted driving) P(r|d,e)   dc d1.25c d1.5c rc r1.25c r1.5c 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.7  1.0 1.0 1.0  Figure 4 illustrates selected P(r|d,e) for the distracted driver. The driver appears to start with a good perception of distance at d1.5c. Here, the probability of perceiving the distance correctly is 0.7. But the driver keeps on proceeding to d1.25 and d1c. At these distances, the probability of correct perception is only 0.4.             9       Figure 4. P(r|d,e) for distracted driver  For solving the decision problem, marginal probabilities are required. These are calculated as follows: P(r|e)=¡ÆP¡¯(d) P(r|d,e). The results are shown in Table 3.          Table 3. Example marginal probabilities P(r|e) (for d=d1.5c) r r1.25c r1.5c Sum 0.17 0.25 0.58 1.00          Note: P(r0|e0) = 1.0 The posterior probabilities (i.e., revised probability on the basis of obtaining further information before issuing a driver alert), shown in Table 4, are calculated as shown below:  P"(d|r,e)=[P'(d).P(r|d,e)]/{ [P'(d).P(r|d,e)]}            Table 4.

That is, the value or gain of providing a driver alert can be specified in the form of a Gain Matrix (G) (Table 5). The values can be specified on a -1 to +1 scale, with +1 being the highest gain and -1 being the highest penalty. Other ranges can be used. Also, utility-theory based functions can be employed for generating the G matrix. Further, sensitivity tests can be carried out in arriving at a satisfactory G matrix.        OPTIMAL TIMING AND NATURE OF DRIVER ALERT       Now the algorithm can be solved as follows. The probability distributions of P¡¯(d) and P(r|d,e) are used as starting point for the estimation of the joint probability measure P(d,r|e) for each information acquisition activity e. Equations are defined for applicable sequences of e,r,a,d. The desirability of a sequence (e, r, a, d) or (e0, r0, a, d) is completely described by the G matrix  10 G(e,r,a,d) or G(a,d) for the case of e0 and r0 or when G(e,r) is kept as a variable internal to the computation process.       Table 5. Gain matrix (G)        System Action dc d1.25c d1.5c a0 aA aR -1 0.5 1.0 -0.5 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.25 -0.25           Note: These values can be changed by the designer. Given the prior probability and the conditional probability, the marginal probability and the posterior probability can be computed as noted earlier. The theoretical basis of the methodology assumes that each information acquisition activity option (e0, ew) can be characterized by a conditional probability of P(r|d,e), such that the relationship between the prior and posterior probabilities is as given by the Bayes Theorem (11). The expected gain for each act a, for each (e,r) combination can be found as follows. Here, G is used to designate gain and G* represents expected gain which is weighted by the probabilities. G*(a,r,e)= ¡Æ for all d ( P¡±(d|r,e).[G(e,r,a,d)]                                                                                         In the case of no additional information acquisition, G*(a,r0,e0)= ¡Æ for all d( P¡±(d|r0,e0).[G(e0,r0,a,d)]  For each (e, r) combination, an optimal a and its associated maximum G are found. G*(r,e) = Maxa G*(a,r,e)                                          For each e, the expected G can be found: G*(e) = ¦²r [P(r|e) G*(r,e)]                                           If more than one e is to be performed, the optimal e is that for which G*(e) is maximum.   G*(e*) = Maxe G*(e)    This case does not apply in the present application. It should be pointed out that the purpose of this step is to find relative gains of additional data acquisition alternatives. Here, we have only one -- ew                                          If the optimal e turns out to be ew, it is of interest to know the value of information acquired.  This involves determining the increase in the optimal G which would result for each r if the prior choice of terminal action a was altered after posterior information was attained. In operational terms, the expected gain of the optimal alternative under prior information (a¡¯) is to be subtracted from the expected gain of the optimal alternative under  posterior probabilities (ar).  Or,  Vt*(e) = ¦²rP(r|e)[¦²d P¡±(d|r,e)Gt(ar,d)-¦²d P¡±(d|r,e)Gt(a¡¯,d)]                                                  Where Vt*(e) is the value of information and subscript ¡°t¡± refers to the terminal gain (i.e., G obtainable from an a) in terms of the optimal course of action.  11 It should be noted that the expected terminal gain of a particular e is the expected terminal gain of an immediate terminal action plus the expected value of information obtained from the e. This can be expressed in equation form as shown below. Gt*(e) = Gt*(e0) + Vt*(e)               Now, the expected net gain of additional information acquisition can be determined to be the expected value of new information less the expected cost of obtaining it. In equation form: v*(e) = Vt*(e) - cs*(e)                                                       where, cs*(e) = Gs*(e) = ¡ÆrP(r|e) Gs(e, r)  In the present Bayesian model, the cs*(e)= 0. That is, there is no penalty encountered if ew is employed. Therefore, v*(e) = Vt*(e)                                                      If the Vt*(e)>0, then ew is the optimal course of action (i.e., wait for a moment for additional information before giving the alert message).  Results of the freeway distracted driving example application of the model are presented in Table 6. The optimal courses of action are shown when the driver is at various locations. Model results show that at d1.5c, the driver is driving in a non-distracted manner and that the warning system is in the monitoring mode (i.e., additional information is being gathered and that no alert message is required. As the driver reaches d1.25c in a somewhat distracted condition, the system is gathering additional information on driver intention and if confirmed, amber alert will be given. In spite of the amber alert, this distracted driver moves even closer to the leading vehicle (at d1.0c). The system has decided to issue a red alert without waiting for further information on driver action.       Table 6. Optimal courses of action Location of vehicle & prior probabilities  d1.5c P¡¯(d1.0c) = 0.1 P¡¯(d1.25c) = 0.2 P¡¯(d1.5c) = 0.7 d1.25c P¡¯(d1.0c) = 0.15 P¡¯(d1.25c) = 0.7 P¡¯(d1.5c) = 0.15 d1.0c P¡¯(d1.0c) = 0.7 P¡¯(d1.25c)= 0.2 P¡¯(d1.5c)= 0.1 Driver distraction Not distracted Somewhat distracted Distracted Optimal course of action ew & a0 ew & aA e0 &aR  CONCLUSIONS  (1) The Bayesian-Monte Carlo Model for collision avoidance system design of the cognitive connected vehicle meets the requirements of incorporating driver distraction, aggressiveness in driving or lack of it, treating the uncertainties in dynamic traffic environment, and reducing nuisance alarms by acquiring additional information on driver intent. The adaptive and self-calibrating features of the model enable it to handle a variety of driving modes.   (2) The model can aid in the design of the crash prevention system since it can answer two most important questions: what type of alert message to provide and when to provide it.  12 (3) The example application suggests that the collision avoidance system is producing logical results.      (4) The Bayesian-Monte Carlo model can potentially be of immediate use in designing the collision avoidance system of the cognitive connected vehicle.

-1- IMPROVED METHOD TO CALCULATE THE TIME TO COLLISION OF TWO VEHICLES   Felipe Jim¨¦nez, Luis Garc¨ªa-Menacho, Jos¨¦ Eugenio Naranjo  Universidad Polit¨¦cnica de Madrid INSIA- Campus Sur UPM. Carretera de Valencia km 7, 28031 Madrid (Spain) Telephone: +34 91 336 53 17, FAX: +34 91 336 53 02, E-mail: felipe.jimenez@upm.es  ABSTRACT In order to improve integrated s afety models of road vehicles, it has been recen tly defined a phase of interaction between system s of primary and secondary safety. These systems reuse information provided by prim ary systems to achieve the secondary system s¡¯ objectives. It is essential to discriminate whether a collision is avoidable or not and to c alculate the available time before the crash happens. This paper sh ows a m ethod that im proves other sim plified methods found in the literature to calculate T TC (Time to co llision). Some examples are explained in order to show the benefits of this method.   KEYWORDS: Time to collision, precrash, laser  INTRODUCTION The traffic accident data of the last years sho w a clear reduction. T his reduction is bein g achieved by the introduction of measures that affects all areas of road transport (infrastructure, vehicle and driver) [1]. Perhaps, wh ere these advances are most evident is in the area of the vehicle, with the introduction of numerous safety systems.  It is estim ated that 90 % of accidents are caused by hum an error, potentially induced  distractions, misjudgment or lack of knowledge of the situation [2]. Thus, system s are being introduced to help to improve drivers' perception of the environment, and systems that process information and alert the driver of potential hazards, and even act if it is necessary.  We can distinguish prim ary safety system s which are designed to av oid accidents, whereas secondary safety system s attempt to reduce a ccident consequences. Active safety system s provide the vehicle of intelligent systems able to predict and prevent accidents that th e driver alone could not con trol. Different studies show that the po tential that offer the f irst ones is  -2- much higher than the second and part of the m argin of improvement of these second systems is cond itioned to em ploy inf ormation cap tured by spec ific sen sors of  the pr imary saf ety systems. The incorporation of advanced technologies in vehicles has improved the protection of vehicle occupants and pedestri ans, reducing road ac cidents in the la st decade despite the huge increase of the vehicle fleet and mobility.   In order to improve integrated s afety models of road vehicles, it has been recen tly defined a phase of interaction between system s of primary and secondary safety (figure 1). So there is also a third group of safety system s, pre-collision systems, overlapping the previous ones, as they reuse inform ation provided by prim ary systems to achieve the secondary system s¡¯ objectives. They use information before captured the accident by the sensors so that they can act on the control and protection systems in order to reduce the consequences of the acciden t. They allow  taking m easures som e seconds in  advance, allowing new m easures and/or increasing their effectiveness. Some of the actions are automatic braking, automatic action on steering sys tem to im prove the an gle of im pact, p retensioners action , preparation of the airbags, measures to improve the compatibility between vehicles such as extendable bumpers, suspension height control, etc., or even the deployment of measures to minimize the effects of pedestrian accidents. However, it is necessary to develop sensors and algorithms for detecting an imminent collision [3], estim ating time unt il it happens, and finally deciding when it becomes unavoidable.    Figure 1: Integrated safety model [4]  The anticipation allows us to adopt measures that otherwise would not be possible or would not be so effective. It is essential to know [5]: - Identify the obstacles and their characteristics - Discriminating if the accident will occur and with what probability -3- - Determine the configuration of the accident - Determine when it will occur the accident (Time to collision TTC) and what actions can be taken to avoid it and the time available for it (Time to avoidance TTA)  So far , i mportant projects have been devel oped in line with the pr e-collision system s. Specifically, for exam ple, it can be noted th e Integrated Project PREVENT [6] within th e Sixth Fram ework Program , which includes severa l sub-projects in wh ich data fusion is considered to represent the environment and take action before the collision or preparation for it.  The evaluation of the ef fectiveness and poss ible limitations of pre-collision systems have been studied in several projects such as the European project ASSESS [7]. This project aims to develop evaluation procedures. These procedures will be performed to evaluate the driver, the behavior of the pre-collision system , and the socio -economic impact assessment. The main objectives are to  develop  standardized  assessm ent procedures aim ed at th e front pre-crash systems. These system s detect hazardous situations and trig ger active and passive safety sys tems before an unavo idable acc ident happens. Assessm ent tools provide recommendations to facilitate implementation of the most important technologies and identify barriers that introduce integrated  safety systems. W ith early action, the ef fectiveness of passive safety systems can be increased by 10% [8] and, moreover, it is estim ated that only 50% of the potential of active safety systems have been utilized to the time. Keep in mind that, if about half a second more availab le, 60% of acciden ts could be avoided and if you have 1 second, this figure would reach 90%. According to this, and bearing in mind that in 2 thirds of the accidents there is a longer tim e between the triggering event and the im pact, there is the clear possibility of action. In [9], the authors examined the effects of pre-collision systems in 50 accident scenarios. Actions to be consid ered are: aud ible, visual and haptic warnings, applying tension to the seatbelts and pressure to  the brakes autom atically in case the system  detects a collision. Researches show that the system could have prevented 38% of accidents, with a redu ction of 44% the probability to have fatal results. Another study by Daim ler Chrysler and Mercedes [10] suggests reductions of 30-50% in  head injuries and 20-40% in neck.   This work is within th e f ield of  pre-co llision system s, in particu lar, in calculating th e remaining time before the collision and improving algorithms proposed in previous works. In this sense, one key aspect in these systems is the decision whether a collision is unavoidable or not, as it conditions the type of action the ve hicle should take automatically (reversible or irreversible steps). T o this end, from real-tim e analysis of the situation, the system should calculate the TTC (Time-to-collision) and compare with the TTA (Time-To-Avoidance).  -4-  SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF TTC In [11], the authors present a procedure to calculate the time of collision between two vehicles. Data that are considered are the in itial positions of vehicles, their speeds and directions and senses, and assumes that the vehicles are tw o ideal points (figure 2) . Then calculates th e intersection of the two vehicles, given by the following expressions:  2111221221112212cotcot)cotcot()(tantan)tantan()(¦È¦È¦È¦È¦È¦È¦È¦È¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ=¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ=++yyxxyxxyyx    Figure 2: Simplified diagram for the calculation of the intersection point  Once found, establishes a procedure for calculating the collision time that consist on calculate the time it takes each o f the two vehicles to reach the intersection. When these two tim es coincide, that is the time to collision (TTC).  In order to take into account a margin of safety that encom passes simplifications made, it is considered a factor ¦Á, setting the following relationship to consider collision:  ¦Á<¡þ 21 TTXTTX  -5- where the terms TTX1 and TTX2 are the times it takes the vehicle 1 and vehicle 2 to reach the point of intersection.  The factor ¦Á is a safety parameter. Thereby, for considering a collision occurred is not required to TTX1 = TTX2, but compliance with the previous relationship less strict. The higher the value of ¦Á is, the more conservative the algorithm becomes.   IMPROVED CALCULATION OF TTC The above procedure is simple but the results may become very dependent on the parameter ¦Á. Thus, using the previous methodology, this article presents the calculation but considering that the vehicle geometry is rectangular, which is not accurate, but is a much greater approximation to reality.  When two vehicles cras h, it can be seen that th e corner of one of them is the first thing that comes into contact with each other. This always happens unless they hit perfectly parallel or perfectly perpendicular (Figure 3). In this case, both the corner and the rest of the side contacts with the other vehicle at the same time, so that for the calculation of collision times, we can consider that always strikes first corner.   Figure 3: Collision configurations  In the general case, there are 32 possible situations, as each corner of each car (4 corners) can impact on any of the 4 sides of the other vehicle and this calculation must be repeated with both vehicles. However, previous cases can be reduced to just two, which are described below.   Case 1: The corner of a vehicle hits the side of another vehicle  Figure 4 shows the situation of case 1 in which the corner of a vehicle hits the side of another -6- vehicle. In it, you can see the situation before the collision on the left and the situation at the time of the crash on th e right. The f ront of each vehicle is indicated by a triangle. T he two vehicles move forward. They moves at constant speed and a path defined by dashed lines.   Figure 4: Previous situation to the accident and the accident configuration  In the situation shown, the corner of the vehicle 2, defined by point A2 hits the side CD of the vehicle 1. If the collisio n happens between the corner of vehicl e 2 and the side of vehicle 1, the intersection point should be Q1. For this, two conditions must be met: a) The corner A2 should reach the  position Q1 in a time (TTA2) greater than or equal to what it takes to get D1 (TTD1) to the intersection. b) The time it takes to reach A2 corner to the intersection must be less than or equal to what it takes to get C1 (TTC1) to the intersection, because if C1 arrives before, the vehicle 1 has passed by the intersection point and therefore there is no impact on the corner A2.  So, if TTC1¡Ý TTA2 ¡Ý TTD1, collision occurs and the tim e until the collision is given by the time it takes to reach A2 corner the intersection, ie, TTC = TTA2.   Case 2: The corner of a vehicle hits the front or the back of another vehicle  In this case,  the collisio n of the cor ner of on e of the vehicle is on the front or the back of  another vehicle, as shown in Figure 5. There you can see the diagram before the intersection on the left and the diagram at the tim e of the crash on the right. In this case, A2 is the corner that hits the other vehicle's front (side AD) -7-   Figure 5: Previous situation to the accident and the accident configuration  The collision takes place somewhere on the line between Q1 and Q2. Here is how to calculate in what point of the line occurs. For such a collision occur, two conditions must be met:  a) The point A2 must reach Q1 (TTA21) before the point D1 (TTD1 1). If D1 arriv es before, the collision would not occur on the front of the vehicle 1. b) The point A2 must reach Q2 (TTA22) later than A1 (TTA12).  This case requires m ore calculation, because we do not know at which point in the straight line connecting Q1 and Q2, will be  the collis ion. ¡°L¡± is a variab le defined as th e position along the line that connects Q1-Q2,  and the length of the segm ent from Q1 to Q2 is denoted as L1. It sh ould be analyzed how the point A2  is evolving along this segm ent and how the front of  another vehicle is enter ing in this segm ent, since f irst entering the p oint A1  (previously could not hit the corner A2) until it reaches  the point D1 (after this tim e, the collision would be with the lateral C1-D1, so we are in the previous case). It can be expressed graphically as shown in Figure 6, which seeks the intersection of the following lines:  - Line 1: The A2 com es into th e zone at a time TTA21, where L  = 0, s ince it is th e beginning of the section Q1 -Q2, and comes out of the section in TTA22 when L = L1. - Line 2: A1 takes to get to Q2, the end of the section L = L1, TTA12. And the point D1 takes to get to Q1, beginning of the segment L = 0, TTD11.  -8-  Figure 6: Scheme for the calculation of the moment and the crossover point  The intersection of two lines provides the variable t, which is the time of collision.  In the ev ent that a v ehicle does no t have a uniform motion, the lines in Figure 6 becom e curves. In p articular, consider the case of uniformly decelerated m otion (case in which the driver detects the hazard and initiates the braking maneuver), the curve for that vehicle will be a parabola (Figure 7), being the calculation equivalent.   Figure 7: Scheme for the calculation of the moment and the crossover point  -9- EXAMPLES In order to show the improvements provided by the proposed method here is an example of a configuration of a simple accident. It represents a possible collision between two vehicles that follow ortogonal paths. In turn, we consider two cases of initial speeds. The following table shows these variables. Figure 7 shows the initial situation.     Vehicle 1 Case 1 / Case 2 Vehicle 2 Units Starting  p osition (0,0) (10,-10) m Speed 20 / 25 19 m/s Vehicle width 2 2 m Vehicle length 5 5 m Angle 90 0 ?

CONCLUSIONS This article has presen ted a m ore accurate cal culation of the tim e to collision b etween two vehicles colliding at constant speed along a straight path without excessive computational cost. Obviously, for its proper func tioning it is nec essary to id entify obsta cles and  kinem atic -11- precisely for which there are improved algorithms.  Moreover, the proposed m ethod is easily genera lized to the case of curved paths (if known analytical expression) and is not mandatory for the vehicle m ovement to be uniform, while evolution is known, so it is possible to estimate braking motion that the system could even be done automatically, if deemed necessary to avoid collision.  Finally, it should be noted that the procedure described in [11] on the calculation of TTA remains valid from the results of the improved method presented here.

 -1-RESEARCH ON THE SAFETY DISTANCE MODEL BASED ON CAR-CAR COMMUNICATION   Hua Wang School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology 202 Haihe Road, Nangang District, Harbin  P.R.

The paper presents the improved SDMs based on the development of car-car communication technology characterized of its on-time measurement and communication. The research is focus on analyzing SDMs of the vehicle fleet driving in single lane under car-following status. By considering both the braking theory and driver prediction model, the absolute and relative SDMs are achieved to support decision-making information in corresponding driving conditions. The comparative analysis with tradition four SDMs confirms that the proposed models are able to increase the efficiencies of the vehicle collision prevention system, increase the utilization rate of the road on promise of ensuring the driving safety.  INTRODUCTION  The survey indicates that most malignant accidents are rear-ending chain collisions, which occurs regularly in the conditions of sighting distance lacking, insufficient prediction of driver, the vehicle fault and so on. The Safety Distance Model (SDM) is one key research of the collision prevention system to provide theoretical guarantees and technical support for drivers.  The SDM research rarely takes the vehicle fleet as the research target because of the complex and expensive communication apparatus and the parameters concerning the fleet SDM are relative more and complex. But recently, the development of computer and wireless communication technologies enables the feasibility of car-car communication, which forms a well suited basis for decentralized active safety applications and therefore will reduce accidents and their severity [1]. The car-car communication is characterized the measurement of real-time parameters and communications among several vehicles, which enables proposed SDM can cover all conditions of vehicles¡¯ operation although the vehicles location and status are constantly changing. This paper takes the fleet driving in a single lane as the research  -2-object. The research of vehicle fleet can increase the vehicle density and road capacity, simplify the traffic control by reducing the number of control objects, and furthermore, by employing the aerodynamics analysis and simulation, it is possible to reduce the air resistance to save the vehicle fuel consumption. The traditional SDMs are approximately summarized in four types. (a) The fixed SDM, which is relatively convenient to be used. But the model limits in the safety distance is unable to change with the arterial vehicle speed changing on real time. (b) The SDM based on the braking process, which is a kinematic analysis [2-4]. The model mainly employs the braking characteristics of vehicle to calculate the actual braking distance required when vehicles slow down, especially for the anterior car's static or sudden deceleration to zero. But the traffic efficiency is ignored in this model which results in a relative longer safe distance. (c) Ayres T J etc. proposes the headway based SDM, which focuses on ensuring the traffic efficiency [5-8]. The model extracts typical headways from qualities of statistical data of actual highway driving and is mainly applied to safe guidance on highway. But this model does not fully consider the driving habits and analytical skills drivers and the alarm algorithm is relatively simple in form, its expansibility is limited to fit the driver's practical experience and unsuitable for the status such as the big relative velocity between vehicles and alarm of static barrier. (d) The driver prediction based SDM, which considers the importance of drivers¡¯ subjective feeling factor [9-11].Driver prediction model pays more attentions on the driver's subjective feelings and the judging process of danger compared with the headway method. The SDM under static, emergency deceleration and normal driving working conditions are discussed, but the key parameters are difficult to be determined which affect the model precise. There are also SDM researches about lane changing condition [12-13], lever-warning system [14] and so on.  By analysis the traditional SDMs, this paper synthesizes their merits and presents the update SDMs established on car-car communication technology which is characterized of its on-time measurement and communication. The research is focused on analyzing the vehicle queue in a single lane which is under car-following status. By considering both the braking theory and driver prediction model, the absolute and relative SDMs are achieved whose level warning could support decision-making information to drivers. Finally, the comparative analysis with traditional four models is performed to confirm that the proposed SDMS can raise the efficiencies of the vehicle collision prevention and increase the utilization rate of the road and traffic control.  SAFETY DISTANCE MODEL BASED ON CAR-CAR COMMUNICATION  The car-car communication SDM takes the whole fleet as the research object. Considering the fleet stability, the vehicle with the minimum speed is taken as the base vehicle, and the vehicles behind tend to the minimum speed in a certain period of time. Several vehicles in the fleet¡¯s special place require analysis separately. The paper presents two classification methods, such as the absolute SDM and the relative SDM. Absolute safety distance means the vehicle  -3-speed in anterior suddenly brakes to zero (this case contains static condition of anterior vehicle). Relatively safety distance is calculated based on the relative speed between vehicles which include the case that anterior vehicle drives in an even speed. Because of the real-time measurement and communications of vehicle speed, the model can cover all conditions of vehicles¡¯ operation although the vehicles location and state are constantly changing. The proposed SDM can well describe vehicle state and ensure the safety, orderly and efficient operation.  HYPOTHESIS Firstly, below assumptions are given for establishing the SDM. (1) The condition is assumed in the highway. Vehicles in the queue can communicate with each other. (2) The parameters employed in the paper are available and can be used directly. (3) Ignore time delay of the information transmission and assume that vehicles achieve the traffic information simultaneously. (4) Ignore the calculation period of safety distance algorithm.  MODEL CONCEPT Combining the car-car communication technology and the vehicle braking process, the SDM more suitable for actual environment are established, which analysis the vehicle fleet driving in a single lane in following status. Firstly, determine vehicle with the minimum speed as the basis. Then form one sub-team together with its following vehicles and the other sub-team with its anterior vehicles. The anterior sub-team can be separated into another two sub-teams similarly and repeats the separation. Consequently, each sub-team consists of the vehicle with minimum speed, the following vehicle and the remained vehicles. Because of the special characteristic of the forefront and the minimum speed vehicles, the proposed SDMs only concern on researching the following vehicle of basis vehicle and the remained vehicles.  Symbols employed in the research: iS £ºthe safety distance between the ith vehicle and the 1i¡þ th vehicle£» 1S £ºthe driving distance during the driver reaction and braking relay time.£» 2S £ºthe driving distance during the braking acceleration raising time; 3S £ºthe driving distance during braking with the maximum acceleration until reaching the speed of the anterior vehicle;£» 4S £ºthe driving distance of the anterior vehicle during braking until reaching the speed of the base vehicle; ijv £ºthe speed of the ith vehicle at j  time;   -4-ija £ºthe acceleration of the ith vehicle at j  time; iA £ºthe maximum acceleration of the ith vehicle£» 1iT £ºthe driver reaction time of the ith vehicle£» 2iT £ºthe braking delay time of ith vehicle£» 3iT £ºthe acceleration raising time of the ith vehicle£» 4iT £ºthe continuous braking time of the ith vehicle£» 0D £ºthe required distance after stopping of two vehicles£» t¡þ£ºthe measurement time period£» inv £ºthe speed of the ith vehicle at the nth time, which indicates the speed at the highest braking acceleration; it £ºthe time that the ith vehicle reaches the speed of the anterior vehicle during braking acceleration.  THE SDM OF THE VEHICLE FOLLOWING THE MINIMUM SPEED VEHICLE Any driving operation of the vehicle with the minimum speed in the sub-team can affect the states of following vehicles. Its SDM is divided into two cases: absolute SDM and relative SDM. (1) Absolute SDM    Absolute safety distance means the speed of the anterior vehicle suddenly brakes to zero. The SDM can be established by combining with vehicle braking kinematics as follows.  1 2 3 4 0Si S S S S D¡þ ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ                    (1) £¨a£©Reaction period The speed is a constant during this period. 1 0 1 2( )ii iS v T T¡þ ¡þ                        (2) £¨b£©Braking acceleration raising period  The SDM established in this paper employs the real-time braking accelerations, and the safe distance is achieved by continuous correcting the self status, which is more fitting the actual condition.

By employing the car-car communication, the two adjacent vehicles can receive the information for anterior vehicle simultaneously. Consequently, the braking processed of the two vehicles both consider the driver's reaction time. The calculating concepts are the same as SDMs proposed in Section 2.2.1. S1, S2, S3 are the same as eq. (2), (5) and (8). The difference appears significantly of calculation of S4.

Hydraulic brake system response time is 0.015 ~ 0.03s and pneumatic brake system is 0.05 ~ 0.06s. The time of braking force growth is affected by the brake structure. For the hydraulic brake, it generally takes between 0.2 ~ 0.9 s while for the pneumatic brake, the value is 0.3~0.9s. Generally, the average value is employed, such as the hydraulic brake system is 0.55s and the pneumatic braking system is 0.6s. After the two vehicles both stop, the maintained distance usually takes as 2~5m. Considering the security and system latency, in order to reduce the false warning, the distance is decided as 3m.  MODEL EVALUATIONS The reasonable SDM should ensure the driving safety between vehicles and increase the road utilization rate with considering the subjective feeling of drivers. The proposed SDMs take the vehicle fleet driving in a single lane as the analysis object. The minimum speed vehicle, the following vehicle and the remained vehicles in the sub-team are the cores of the presented SDMs. Consequently, the sub-team composed by the three vehicles at these three positions is representative and employed of the model evaluation.  Actually, the driving conditions of the first vehicle are mainly static, emergency braking and normal driving conditions. The second vehicle has two situations corresponding to the driving condition changing of the first vehicle. One is the safe distance with the speed decelerating to zero, and the other is the maintained safe distance with speed decelerating to the minimum speed of the sub-team. Suppose vehicles use hydraulic brake system whose brake response time is 0.023s, growth time of braking acceleration is 0.55s, and road adhesion coefficient is 0.5, then the vehicle maximum braking acceleration can be achieved as 4.9m/s2. In order to evaluate the proposed SDM, the comparison analysis is performed among the new model and four traditional SDMs by using the three-vehicle model under the emergency braking and normal speed driving conditions. The experimental results are shown in Fig. (1)~ Fig. (5). In all figures, A indicates the fixed SDM. B indicates the headway SDM. C indicated the SDM based on vehicle braking process. D indicated the improved driving prediction SDM.E indicates the car-car communication based SDM which is proposed in this paper.  Figure (1) indicates the safety distances of five models between the anterior two vehicles under the condition that the first vehicle emergency braking. The speed of the first vehicle before emergency braking is set as 50km/h. It has been proved that the D model is more suitable for the reality, and consequently, the comparison is mainly taken with D model. The figure indicates that the safety distance is smaller than D model in low speed road section and bigger in high speed road section. Actually, the malignant accident rarely happens in the low speed section and the relative short safety distance can meet the requirement. While in the high speed section, a longer safety distance is preferable for ensuring the driving safety, which   -9-   indicates that model E exactly fits the reality. Figure (2) shows the safety distances of five models between the behind two vehicles under both the conditions of emergency braking and normal speed of the first vehicle. The speed of the second car is set as 60km/h. The results achieved by model D and E are similar in low speed section. In high speed road section, the safety distance calculated by the proposed model is relative small. The reason is that the driver can get the information of anterior car simultaneously by car-car communication, which results in the reduction of reaction time.

Consequently, the model E can raise the road utilization rate on the promise of ensuring vehicles safety. Figure (4) and (5) compare the evaluation results of five models with the first vehicle driving in normal, which gives the same conclusion as the emergency braking condition. CONCLUSIONS Based on communication technology and the sharing information between vehicles, the SDMs focused on analyzing the vehicle fleet driving in a single lane are established by considering both the braking theory and driver prediction model. However, the paper does not consider the vehicle lane changing and the safety distance between the vehicles in the side lane, which will be researched in the future work.  Compared with other traditional SDMs, the proposed algorithm can better represent the actual braking and motion processes, and reflect the safe distance changed caused by different actual driving condition. The absolute and relative SDMs are achieved to support decision-making information to driver in corresponding driving conditions. By the comparative analysis, the proposed SDMs are confirmed to be able to raise the efficiencies of the vehicle collision prevention system, increase the utilization rate of the road and traffic control.

Then the two algorithms were integratedeffectively according to the D-S theory when the algorithms are simultaneously valid. Finally,the algorithms were validated with the fixed detector data, floating car data and event datacollected from expressways in Beijing. The results showed that the single data basedalgorithms could meet the basic needs of practical application at detection rate (DR) and falsealarm rate (FAR), and the integrated detection algorithm had better performance than theclassical algorithms and the two sub-algorithms at the false alarm rate (FAR).Key words£ºIntelligent transportation system (ITS); traffic automatic incident detection (AID);urban expressway; D-S theory2The automatic traffic incident detection is an essential component of the expresswayemergency management system. The enhancement of automatic traffic incident detectionalgorithm performance will remarkable improves the capability of traffic events managementsystem. Because of the far installation distance of fixed detector, the serious data flaw resultedfrom the correspondence breakdown as well as the limitation of floating vehicle quantity, thesingle traffic data source based expressway automatic incident detection algorithms oftenhave unsatisfied results, and create frequently the long time detection interruption, or unableto examine successfully. In recent years, with the unceasingly accumulation of multiplesources historical traffic data including the fixed detectors, the floating car data, it become anew direction to improve the accuracy of traffic incident detection algorithm using the trafficinformation contained in various traffic data.Since last of 1990s, some researchers have started to study how to effective utilizemultiple data sources to conduct the event automatic detection[1-6], these algorithms weredesigned according to respective develop environment and the database structure, and haverespective characteristic and the applicability. The information fusion methods used in thesealgorithms includes the data level fusion and the decision-making level fusion. The data levelfusion requests the multiple data is available and has a higher requirement to database quality.However, the Decision-making level fusion is more flexible, and has a stronger ability onperformances of the fault tolerance and anti-jamming.Based on characteristic analysis of Beijing expressway traffic data, the paper take thedata collected from the floating car data (FCD) system and the fixed microwave detectors asthe foundation, and propose two incident automatic detection algorithms based on single datasource which can be used when one of the data source is not available or has great flaws.When two kinds of data sources simultaneously exist, the D-S fusion method will be appliedto enhance the performance of automatic incident detection (AID) algorithm.1 INTRODUCTION OF D-S THEORYDempster-Shafer (D-S) theory [7] is an uncertain ratiocinative method proposed by A.PDempster, and further developed by G. Shafer. D-S theory has the merit to reveal theuncertain information by using the ¡°section estimation¡±, instead of the ¡°point estimation¡±, andhas obvious flexibility in distinguishing the indetermination information and the collectedaccurate evidence. When the conclusions stemmed from different detectors about theobserved target have conflict, the method can solve the inconsistency with the reliabilitymutual objects set, and ensure to set a larger weight to the result with higher reliability thanthe lower reliability one.1.1BASIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONSAssuming the function 0,1:2 [ ]m Q ? , and satisfy the following requirement:32 1( )A AmQ? =? £¬ 0( )m F = (1)Then, m can be called the basic probability distribution functions on2Q .1.2 RULES FOR THE COMBINATION OF EVIDENCEThe basic evidence inference strategy is dividing the evidence set into two or morenon-correlated parts, and uses them separately to recognize the frame to implement thejudgment independently, then synthesizes the results with the combination rules, thefundamental mode of combination rule is as following (take 2 evidence sets fusion asexample)1 2, ,11( ) ( ) ( )i ji j i jA B A B AA A Bkm m m? =-= ? (2)( ) 0( )m AF ? F= (3)Here, 1m and 2m are basic probability distribution functions which concluded from twoseparate judgments by two evidence or evidence sets, and 1 2, , ( ) ( )i ji j i jA B A Bk A Bm m? =F=?is the conflict coefficient , it reflects the grade of the conflict between evidences.1.3 DECISION-MAKING RULESThe Decision-making rules are critical for a management system. When enforce thedecision-making using the evidence structure of evidence theory, the basic identificationelement (the un-dividable element in identification frameworkW) attribute usually be used tomake decision. In the element attribute based Decision-making, the reliability function valueof element generally selected as the measure of combination rules.There are three important functions in Dempster-Shafer theory, the basic probabilityassignment function (BPA or m), the Belief function (Bel), and the Plausibility function (Pl).Here, we suggest to uses the basic probability assignment function method. The basicprobability assignment is a primitive of evidence theory. Generally speaking, the term ¡°basicprobability assignment¡± does not refer to probability in the classical sense. The BPA,represented by m, defines a mapping of the power set to the interval between 0 and 1, wherethe BPAof the null set is 0 and the summation of the BPA¡¯s of all the subsets of the power setis 1.Q?$ 21,AA satisfy the following functions( ) ( ){ }Q?= ii AAmAm ,max1 £¬ (4)( ) ( ){ }12 ,max AandAAAmAm iii ?Q?= (5)4If( ) ( )( )( ) ( )???¨ª¨¬Q><Q>-mAmmAmAm12121¡þ¡þ(6)Then, 1A will be the combined result, and 21,¡þ¡þ are the specified thresholds.2 SINGLE DATA SOURCE BASED AUTOMATIC INCIDENTDETECTION ALGORITHM FOR EXPRESSWAY2.1 MULTI-PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM BASE ONFIXED DETECTOR DATAThe microwave detector data collected from the Beijing expressway reveal the informationincluding the volume, the speed, the occupancy and the long vehicle volume by lanes. Theseparameters and information can be used to describe the characteristic of traffic flow, and toreflect the evolution rule of the traffic flow operation. Analysis showed that the trafficparameter change is relatively steady or not obvious, when the traffic flow stays at the normalcondition. When the traffic event occurs and affects the upstream detector, traffic parametersof the upstream detectors will have obvious change, but the downstream detectors only havelittle change. Therefore, Traffic parameters change of the upstream and downstream detectorscan be considered as the traffic identification variable to detect the traffic incident.Based on the traffic parameter change analysis before and after traffic events in selected fromtypical road sections, studies indicated that the speed and the occupancy change in spatial andtemporal dimensions has obvious and reasonable relativity with the events, while the trafficvolume change characteristic displayed an inconsistent fluctuation.In some events conditions, the downstream volumes are greater than the upstream because ofthe accesses of expressway. Expressway is different with the freeway, the traffic flow volumemay variable due to the entrances and exits, and the adjacent road section situation are notalways same. Therefore, in order to accurately detect the incident in expressway, the paperselect the occupancy and speed from the upstream and the downstream detectors as the inputparameters. The following algorithm parameters will be calculated for the fixed detector databased multi-parameter detection algorithm.1) The ratio of occupancy difference of adjacent detectors and the upstream occupancy( ) ( )( ) 1,,1,iKtiOCCtiOCCtOCCOCCRDF ?+-= (7)2) The ratio of speed difference of adjacent detectors and the upstream speed( ) ( )( ) 2,,,1KtiVOLtiVOLtiVOLVOLRDF ?-+= (8)53) The change percentage of occupancy in adjacent time intervals for the upstreamdetector( ) ( )( ) 3K,2-,,i?-=tiOCCtiOCCtOCCOCCDEV (9)4) The change percentage of speed in adjacent time intervals for the upstream detector( ) ( )( ) 4K,,2-,?-=tiVOLtiVOLtiVOLVOLDEV (10)Where,OCCRDF =the relatively occupancy difference between the upstream anddownstream;VOLRDF =the relatively speed difference between the upstream and downstream;OCCDEV =the relatively occupancy difference rate of adjacent time intervalsVOLDEV = the relatively speed difference rate of adjacent time intervalsK1, K2, K3, K4 = specified thresholds.In this algorithm, when four judgments are all met the equations (7) to (10), the trafficincident alarm would be triggered.2.2 FLOATING CAR DATA BASED TEMPORAL-SPATIAL TWODIMENSIONS DETECTION ALGORITHMTravel time and travel speed are the most direct and effective traffic parameter to reflect theoperation condition of the road section. By detecting the temporal change as well as thespatial change, it¡¯s possible to identify the impact of traffic event in expressway.The fixed detector only can gather the spot traffic data, and be unable to reveal the operationstatus of road section; however, the floating vehicle data collection system can make up theshortcoming of fixed detectors. On the other hand, the floating car data has the stability andfine coverage in Beijing expressway, and it can be used to detect traffic incident when thefixed microwave detector data is not available. Considered the conveniences, the reliability aswell as the sensitivity of parameter obtain, the paper take the travel speed as the basicalgorithm analysis parameter.The analysis on travel speed also indicated that the identification algorithm usually misreportduring the peak hours and lead to a high misreport rate, when only the temporal travel speedchange were taken into consideration. Therefore, this paper proposed a floating car data basedtemporal-spatial two-dimension detection algorithm.In the time dimension, the difference between the observed travel speeds and the historicaltravel speed are calculated to detect the fluctuation of adjacent time intervals.Set the travel speed is v(t) at the time t , and the travel speeds are v(t - n)£¬v(t-n+1)£¬¡­£¬v(t -1)at the n sampling periods before the time t.6() 1Ktv ? (11)() () ()2t KStvtvSND ?-= (12)Where, SND(t) means normal distribution deviation;v(t) = travel speed measured by the floating car system at a given time;()tv = historical average travel speed on link for a given time-of-day interval;S = standard deviation of the historical travel speed for the given time interval;K1, K2= specified threshold values.In the spatial dimension, the various evolvements of travel speed in upstream anddownstream were tested by the formula (13).() ( ) ( )( ) 3,,i,1t KtiVtVtiVVRDF ?-+= (13)Here, () ( )?=-=niitvntv11 ( ) ()( )21121¨²?¨´¨º?¨¦--= ?=nitvitvnSWhere, VRDF (t) = the relative difference of adjacent road sections¡¯ speeds;V (i, t) = the travel speed of section i at time t;V (i+1, t) = the travel speed of section i+1 at time t;K3= specified threshold value.In the proposed algorithm, when two continuous judgements were both met using theabove three equations from (11) to (13), the traffic event alarm would be triggered.3 D-S THEORY BASED COMPREHENSIVE DETECTIONALGORITHMThe combining of results from the above two individual algorithms during a certain cycle is akind of the decision-making level data fusion. The D-S theory was applied in thecomprehensive algorithm proposed in the paper to improve the reliability of automaticincident detection algorithm than the single data based detection algorithm.In this research, the proposition for judgment is there has event occurs in expressway (A1=event occur; A2=no event occur), and the evidence is the results concluded from the algorithmA (fixed detector data based multi parameter detection algorithm) and algorithm B (floatingcar data based temporal and spatial two-dimensional detection algorithm).In the result fusion process, firstly, each evidences was given a basic confidence level, then,7the basic confidence level will be updated after each detection had finished, and the synthesisconfidence level will be calculated by using the combination rules. Finally, the algorithm willjudge whether the event occurred according to the decision-making rules, and obtain the finalconclusion. The data fusion flow chart as shown in Figure 1:Figure 1. D-S fusion based Event detection flow chart.1) Basic probability assignmentThe principle issue for the data fusion is to evaluate the basic probability of data sources. Thepaper adopted the statistics and evidential method to determine the basic probability. Thecalculation methods were shown as table 1.Table 1.

There were twoevidence obtained in this paper, the formula (2) and (3) were used to calculate thecombination probability distribution functions.3) Decision-making rulesThe Decision-making rules should be selected according to the actual condition of data fusion.Considering the demand of incident detection, the basic probability assignment method wasapplied in the paper.As listed in formula (4), (5) and (6).Fixeddetector dataFloating CardataAlgorithmAAlgorithmBBel1 Pls1Bel2 Pls2Bel1 Pls1Bel2 Pls2D-ScombinationrulesBel1 Pls1Bel2 Pls2Decision-makingrulesConclusion( )2Am1A 2A( )1Am84 VALIDATIONS OF ALGORITHMSThere are two methods can be used to validate the event detection algorithm, one is thesimulation data based algorithm test, the other is the field data based algorithm confirmation.However, the traffic condition is rather ideal under the simulation environment, andcommonly cannot accurately reflect the real traffic condition. Therefore, this researchconducted a field data based algorithm validation. The sample data include the floating cardata, the fixed microwave detector data as well as the real event information in Beijingexpressway during December, 2009 was collected and processed, to validate the detectionalgorithms.The different threshold values set were tested in the algorithm validations, and aim to improvethe detection rate under the specified misreport rate level. Then, the optimized thresholdswere determined. The effect of automatic incident detection (AID) algorithms based ondetector data and floating car data can be obtained.Regarding the validation of comprehensive detection algorithm, two steps were conducted.Firstly, the basic probability of two algorithms can be determined according to the fore-citedbasic confidence level calculation method. Then, the combination probabilities fewer thanfour different conditions resulted from two algorithms as listed in table 3 were calculated asfollowing:( ) ( )8,0.00040.6194,0.3,,Am 211 =QA ( ) ( )0007.0,9991.0,0016.0,,m 212 =QAA( ) ( )0003.0,989.0,0107.0,,m 213 =QAA ( ) ( )0003.0,9672.0,0325.0,,m 214 =QAABased on the combination probabilities, the paper adopted the fore-mentioneddecision-making rules to combine detection results, and set 2.02.00 21 == ¡þ¡þ £¬ , the detectionperformance of the comprehensive algorithm can be concluded.Table 2.

It also named TMC acceptable standard. In orderto validate the algorithm proposed in this paper, we also compared the best detection results ofthe classical California Algorithm, SND algorithm, McMaster algorithm in former research.The evaluations of algorithms were based on two indicators of detection rate (DR) and falsealarm rate (FAR).Table 4. The algorithms performance evaluation.Algorithm typesDetection Rate(DR)false alarm rate(FAR)California 82% 1.73%Modified California #8 68% 0.177%SND 92% 1.3%McMaster 68% 0.0018%Proposed algorithm A:Fixed detector data based multiparameters detection algorithm94.7% 0.968%Proposed algorithm B:Floating Car data based temporal-spatialdetection algorithm89.5% 0.2679%Proposed combination algorithm:D-S Theory based CombinationAlgorithm84.2% 0.034%Acceptable standard for TMC 88% 1.8%From the data in table 4, the conclusions can be drawn as following:(1) The single data based algorithms proposed in this paper have a better performance thanthe classical algorithms on the indicators including detection rate (DR) and false alarm rate(FAR), and both two algorithms will satisfy the TMC acceptable standard, and can meet thepractical application need.(2) The D-S theory based synthesis detection algorithm has a slight decline at detection rate10(DR) compares to the two single data based algorithms, however the examination rate hasreduces, but the false alarm rate (FAR) also have a remarkable reduction of 14% and 96%. Itmight effectively reduce the loss brought by misreport. Though the detection rate (DR) is alittle lower than the TMC acceptable standard, the combination algorithm still can basicallysatisfies the practical application need. Analyzing the reason for low detection rate, possibly isbecause the historical data quantity used to algorithm calibration are still limited, thethreshold value and the parameters still need the further validation. We can use more collecteddata to validate and update the threshold value and the parameters, to further enhance thealgorithm performance.5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKSBased on the fixed detector data and the floating car data, this article respectively proposedtwo single data based detection algorithms, then, a comprehensive algorithm was proposed byapplying the D-S theory into the combination of algorithm results, which might effectivelysolve problems include the limitation of data coverage and high false alarm rate (FAR) forsingle data algorithm. Finally, the algorithm validation analyses were conducted using thetraffic data and event data collected from Beijing expressway. The results indicated that thealgorithm has a better performance in reducing the false alarm rate (FAR), comparing to otherclassical algorithms.On the other hand, this algorithm validation result also has possibility to improve; moresample data can be involved into updating the parameter to enhance the algorithmperformance in the future studies. Moreover, the data fusion based detection algorithmproposed in the paper is the decision-making level fusion, how to consider the characteristicand the adaptability of each algorithm, or conduct the data level fusion to enhance thealgorithm performance is the possible emphasis in the future works.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe authors would like to show great appreciation for the support from Ministry of Scienceand Technology of P.

In  2002 the Tollway opened their state of the art Tr affic and Incident Management System (TIMS), which now manages all ITS devices including CCTV, DMS, and real time traffic information from two sources.  By 2003, TIMS was integrated with the existing Tollway computer aided dispatch (CAD) system.  This allowed incident information from the Illinois State Police and Tollway Maintenance Forces to be directly input into the TIMS system.    Vast amounts of data are produced by both the TIMS and CAD systems daily.  This in turn has created an ever increasing number of inquiries from managers and executives.  The industry was review ed t o und erstand how  othe r a gencies w ere s uccessfully using sim ilar data.  Collectively, ov er 100 different  performance measures were id entified.  Wilb ur S mith 2??identified 26 existing reports and 23 new reports that best matched the To llway data an d operational needs.    Many of t hese reports required a baseline ¨C a defined ¡°normal¡± condition ¨C for which to compare incident conditions.  With a focus on actu al conditions as opp osed to modeled or hypothetical conditions, available sensor data was used to create and validate segment level daily speed profiles across the system.     By comparing daily and average speed profiles near crashes, the Tollway can now directly and accurately determine the measured impact of incidents.  With these new tools, the Illinois Tollway is able to make more informed operational and planning decisions on a v ariety of issues.  INTRODUCTION The Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (Tollway) and its Traffic Engineer (Wilbur Smith Associates, WSA) have always spent a considerable amount of time studying traffic patterns and trends across the Tollway¡¯s system.  Understanding traffic is often very critical for a toll facility because the sole source of income is the revenue generated from its traffic.    Studying safety records (separate from its impact on revenue) became a major focus of the Tollway as early as the 1980s.  In the early  1990s, the Tollway created the Annual Traffic Data Book, which was the first attempt to collect all traffic and safety statistics in one location.  While this source evolved over the years to a larger and more comprehensive report, it has remained the primary source for obtaining quick answers to the many questions posed to the Tollway Maintenance and Traffic Department (Traffic). ?In 2002, the Tollway opened the Traffic and Incident Management System (TIMS).  TIMS combined rea l time traf fic data, availabl e from  electronic toll collection (I-PASS) and microwave detectors s ensors supplied under an Intelligent Tra nsportation Infrastructure Program (ITIP) agreement with the Federal Highway Administration, with information from CCTV and the ability to communicate to users with DMS.  TIMS quickly became a source for real-time answers to many of the questions that are posed to the Tollway daily.   In order to further improve the Tollway¡¯s incident response capabilities, in 2003 the Tollway integrated incident information from its existing computer aided dispatch (CAD) system into TIMS ¨C a first for the nation.  TIMS operators are able to initiate incidents that they observe, and implement response plans for those that were received from the CAD system.    NEED FOR MORE DATA With the vast amounts of data that are produced by both TIMS and CAD systems and demands being placed on the Traffic department for responses to an ever greater number of questions, TIMS became a victim of its own success.  Additionally, even though large amounts of data were available, useful ready information from the data often was not.  The Tollway and the Traffic Engineer set out to determine what could be done with all this data that would be useful for known and anticipated questions.    To accomplish this, the authors conducted a literature search of reports currently used or under development by transportation agencies, as detailed below.  To aid in the analysis, the Traffic Engineer also conducted a r eview of all current reports and available data sets.  With this information, there was a fairly clear picture of what reports made sense for the Tollway.   3?? Several s ystem performance measures have  becom e acce pted and used throughout the industry.  The primary industry focus appears to be with those identified with the FHWA¡¯s Urban Mobility Monitoring P rogram.  This program identified five measures (Travel Time Index, Percent Congested, Delay, Buffer Index, and Planning Time Index) that continue to be tracked across the n ation (1).  Wh ile the focus of the literature review was on ¡°incident management¡± performance measures, many other useful sy stem measures were identified.  For i nstance, d ata from a weigh-in-motion sensor is n ot g enerally rel ated to  in cident management, but th e distribution o f commercial v ehicles m ay play  a significa nt role in  developing metrics associated with specific incidents.    The next three most helpful sources were the Washington DOT congestion measurement summary (2), the Florida DOT SunGuide program ITS Performance Measures summary (3), and an NCH RP guidebook on effectiv e performance measurements (4).  Washington and Florida have developed and are using numerous performance measures on an ongoing basis.  Periodical reports are available from both that detail various measures.  Additional sources for performance measures incl uded inte rnal reports a nd occasional vendor m anuals.  Collectively, over 100 different incident management performance measures were identified.  ESTABLISHING A BASELINE Several of the id entified perfor mance measures requ ired a b aseline, or a ben chmark fo r comparison.  That is, they would compare traffic conditions occurring in a specific situation to an undefined normal condition of t raffic.  In relation to this, Zeng noted that ¡°as overall expectation of traffic conditions changes over the course of the day, it is necessary to build an expectation or background profile that capture this dynamic in the traffic stream under both free-flow and recurrent congestion conditions.¡± (5)  Therefore, development of this baseline was necessary in compiling many of the identified performance measures.  This led to two important questions: how is a normal condition of traffic defined, and how do we define the impact that is related to an incident?  During this time, the Traffic Engineer had worked with a subconsultant to develop daily and seasonal fiv e minute speed profiles fro m available sensor data .  W eekday and weekend seasonal average speeds were computed.  Along with this, there was some data cleansing (e.g., dropping lanes with zero data, etc.) and other statistics were computed including the standard deviation.  O h (6) had identified the standard deviation as a potential separation between ¡°normal¡± and non-recurring conditions, and this seemed intuitively appealing to the authors, although very little other research with real world data could be found supporting this.    There are several ideas throughout the industry as to w hat constitutes the end of inci dent impact.  Since the Tollway had good information from their CAD system, there were several different measures that could be directly computed, depending on how the incident duration was defined.  For example, you could d efine the end of the in cident as when the incident record in the CAD system is closed, or when the last unit is cleared.  These are more correctly defined as total response time.  However, defining the total impact of the incident on traffic is more troublesome.  Most researchers tried to define this time as Saka (7) eloquently stated ¡°the post-incident recovery time is defined as that time beyond the clearing of an incident when pre-incident traffic conditions are achieved and traffic h as returned to normalcy or s teady state.¡±  However, very few could define ¡°normalcy¡± in a way that could be measured.      4IDENTIFYING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND REPORTS As identified above, a considerable number of reports were identified by Florida DOT w ith their SunGuide program (3), Washington State DOT with the Gray Notebook (2), and from the NCHRP report on Project 3-68 (4).  Additionally, the Traffic Engin eer already compiles a significant amount of data and produces many reports for the Tollway on a regular basis. This includes the annual traffic report, annual crash report, annual revenue report, and numerous others throughout the course of a typical year. Finally, the Tollway creates many more reports internally for use in operations.  The authors met with the operations managers for both TIMS and the CAD system to compile a list of reports that were currently generated and to identify those areas where new reports or information were desirable.  THE DATA MAP Concurrent with the identification of the potential reports, the authors created a map of the data available and used by the Tollway.  This map identified the various databases, the owner of the database (whoever was responsible for maintaining the database), and the attributes of the data.  Before meeting with Tollway staff, the Traffic Engineer inventoried in-house databases and reports. This included identifying where each item of information is generated. In addition to the data created and maintained in TIMS and CAD, there is additional data such as electronic toll collection (I-PASS) usage, and classification counts that are maintained in other Tollway databases s eparate fro m th e TIMS and CA D sy stems. In  general, these v arious da ta sources are not combined into a single ¡°super¡± database, but are used by a variety of departments within the Tollway.  The end  result of this investigation was the creation of the traffic data map illustrated in Figure 1. This map illustrates all tables and fields that the Traffic Engineer maint ains for the Tollway and the source data for each. While i t illustrates ho w the v arious tables are link ed to  each other, it is important to note that many of these linkages are manual. For example, traffic data may be co llected electronically as point  information perhaps from  a sensor, but t hen manually aggregated and applied to larger segments. The data map illustrates how information currently is related to other sources of information.  The following list explains much of the most useful data.  Plaza Counts The data within the traffic data map comes from a variety of sources. As a tolled facility, there are detailed counts by  hour and class at all toll collection locations. These counts co me primarily from toll classification detectors at each lane. This is true both with the cash system and the electronic toll collection (I-PASS) system. These detailed records are used to develop numerous factors suc h as daily and monthly variations, vehicle classifications, and hourly traffic distributions.  Figure 1 ¨C Data Map 5??Traffic Sensors There are two primary sources of real time traffic information.  The first is through electronic toll collection (I-PASS) data.  Travel time data from this source is used to calculate speeds on Tollway segments. Segments are generally defined as toll plaza to toll plaza.  While this data is more aggregated than point sensor information, it covers the entire system.    In 2004, the Tollway entered into an agreement with Traffic.com after winning an ITIP grant.  Approximately 84 remote traffic monitoring system microwave sensors were deployed across the urban areas of the Tollway.  Real time data from these sensors was also integrated into the TIMS system.  This data includes count and speed information. Over the succeeding years, the Tollway has deployed additional microwave detectors including increasing the density of the sensors to approxi mately one per m ile in the covered areas, bringing the total number of sensors to around 150.  This data is the primary source for all baselines.  Lane Closures Lane closures for construction and maintenance are input into TIMS daily for the real time use by operators. However, the lane closure information is not archived at TIMS because it is a secondary user of the data.  The source of the electronic information on lane closures is the geographic information system (GIS) group at the Tollway. This information is available at any time, but collected by the Traffic Engineer on a monthly basis.  The d ata in cludes all infor mation for both tem porary and long-te rm lane closures si nce February of 2006.   The lane closure information includes the route, mileposts, the date and time, duration, and the type of closure. Also included is information on lane shifts and shoulder closures.  Crash Data The Traffic Engineer compiles crash data on a m onthly basis fro m the Illinois State Police (ISP). This data is generally from the ISP Mobile Crash Report (M), a system that logs the information directly into a database on a computer in the ISP vehicle. A small percentage of paper reports are also created each month.  Collectively, the Tollway and the Traffic Engineer analyze crash data on a monthly basis.   The crash data fro m the IS P includ e all information en tered on the crash r eport for m.  Additional information is available on crashes from the CAD.  The CAD system has several similar items of data ( e.g., date/time, location) but also has additional information including such items as dispatched units and times as well as lanes blocked. For current routine reports, the two data sets are not merged.  For many of the reports and p erformance m easures identified in this effort, there is still not a need to merge the two; one or the other will have all the information.  However, some reports do require matching information between the two sources.  CAD  The majority of the infor mation within the CAD system is input by an operator. There is limited automatic vehicle location data available to CAD, and this information is not generally available for use in these reports. Additionally, some information is automatically entered into an incident report (e.g., officer ID, date and time). At the Illinois Tollway, the CAD system is operated jointly for Tollway maintenance and traffic, as well as for the ISP District 15.  It is rather unusual that the two separate entities share a CAD system and database.  The Tollway is very careful to maintain security and privacy in the sharing of data.   6?? The CAD system comes with many standard reports and an ad hoc report generation capability.  The CAD system has a wealth of information available in both designated fields, as well as in a large, near free-form text field. For many of the reports identified, a simple script on the part of the CAD vendor may be required to obtain the information in a useful format.  For others, in order to get the necessary information from the system, the text field has to be read and parsed or new data elements created.    Other TIMS Data TIMS is designed over the long term to be the center of all real time operations for the Tollway.  Much of the information from other sources (e.g., lane closures, incident data) are available in TIMS, and additional actions are also monitored.  This includes the status and use of field devices such as CCTV cameras and Dynamic Message Signs (DMS).  Actions related to the access and use of these systems is recorded at TIMS.  Of particular note for this effort is the use of the DMS relative to incidents.  In a recent upgrade, DMS messages are directly related to incident occurrences and can now be tracked in terms of time, messages, passing volume, and other measures.    All information from the CAD is available to the TIMS system.  TIMS staff have the ability to view and modify information (e.g., left vs. right shoulder) and confirm existence of an incident through CCTV.  Additionally, TIMS has the ability to create incidents that are directly sent back into the CAD system.  Consequently, a signi ficant amount of information is directly available in TIMS and can be merged and compared to other data (e.g., number of incidents that were first confirmed by CCTV).    INITIAL REPORT AND PERFORMANCE MEASURE SUMMARY Armed with the inventory of existing data and the list of reports used in other locations across the country, individual measures were examined for applicability to the Tollway and ease of development. Each report or measure first had to be def ined.  Since there was not always a formula or explanation with each measure from the literature review, each was defined as best as possib le. O ften repo rts identified in o ther locat ions carried no explanation a s t o th e computations.  Whi le some titles seemed self explanatory (e.g., Servi ce Vehicle Incident Response Time), there were many questions that had to be answered to directly implement with the Tollway (e.g., only service patrol v ehicles or any agency vehicle; urban, rural, or both; arrival time vs. dispatch time or incident notification time)?  This created some uncertainty as to exactly what was being measured. When there was any uncertainty, the authors interpreted the formulas in a manner that best fit the data and resources of the Tollway.  Each report was then compared to exis ting Toll way report s.  If an exist ing report w as si milar, t his w as recorded as an existing report.    BASELINING As identified above, the Traffic Engineer and its subconsultant were already developing a baseline history of sensor data.  They completed an exhaustive analysis of the current sensors with t he Tollway.  This i ncluded c omparing I-PASS with d etector speeds, levels of  aggregation, speed vs. o ccupancy, and sensor quality.  This information was presented and discussed with the Tollway.  In the end, it was decided to use speed profile averages and to initially define i ncident times as those less than one standard deviation bel ow av erage, computed over five -minute ti me p eriods by  season.  While a y ear¡¯s wo rth of data w as approximately 4GB, some initial cleaning and aggregation got the database down to a level that was workable with MS Access on a typical PC.   7?? This was th e initial implementation that allowed the Traffic Engineer to start computing several of the new reports and perfor mance measures. For  exam ple, for recurring v s. non-recurring congestion, segment level seasonal speed curves were used and a ny speeds below 60 mph were assumed to represent congestion.  Daily curves were then used to identify all segment-day-time periods where the speeds were more than one standard deviation below the segment level seasonal speed curve (6).  The assumption was any speeds below this point were a result of some non-recurring event.  Recurring congestion was then calculated as the difference between total congestion and non-recurring congestion.   DIRECTLY IDENTIFYING INCIDENT IMPACTS Discussions with others within the industry reinforced the concern of how to directly calculate the impact of an incident.  There are so many variables that affect traffic every second, how could this impact be accurately isolated.  The intent of the authors was to generate a first approximation of the impact, not to exhaustively analyze the statistical significance of the results, but to come up with a set of rules that generally captured what impacts that logically could be associated to an incident.    REVERSE ENGINEERING ASH IMPACT LOGIC The Tollway defines incidents as any event that impacts traffic, including stalled vehicles and debris in the road.  The following analysis was applied just to crashes ¨C those events that generated a crash report with the ISP ¨C however the terms may be used interchangeably.  The team started by examining several crashes, and the sensor data within the vicinity of the crash on that day.  Initially, crashes were selecte d that would be expected to create delays (e.g., injury crash during rush hour).  Rules were developed that would match the sensor data that clearly showed an impact.  These rules were then applied to a series of random crashes to see how well they applied.  The rules would be refined and reapplied to other crashes.  After several iterations, the team believed they had a set of rules that generally matched impacts to crashes.  The highlights of the rules are as follows:  Pre Crash Conditions The impact area had to be compared against how traffic was performing prior to the incident.  The four time periods prior to the crash time at the closest upstream sensor for that day were averaged and compared to the average curve.  While there are periods of rapidly changing speeds, it was observed that in general this amount of time was necessary to properly establish any daily trends in traffic.  So the team computed a delta as a difference between the crash day and the average day.  Only negative (crash day worse than average) delta¡¯s were used.  If the delta was positive, it was reduced to zero.  Compared to Average In general, the actual times after the crash were directly compared to the expected average times.  There were two variations applied to the average.  First, the daily delta was used to potentially reduce the average curve.  Th e delta was applied uniformly to the en tire daily curve.  Second, a noise factor of 3 miles per hour was used.  It was felt that the sensor data was variable enough that any results within 3 miles per hour were close to exact.  Number of Sensors Depending on the e xact locations of sensors a nd crashes, and local geometric and traffic conditions, sometimes the impact of a crash was felt more at the next upstream sensor.  At 8least two sensors were examined for each crash, and any upstream sensor that matched the impact conditions was used.    Return to Normalcy Normalcy is conceptu ally defined as pre-crash conditions relative to average.  That is, and incident that occurs during the end of rush hour won¡¯t necessarily be considered over when rush hour conditions return, but when traffic speeds are b ack where expected.  Us ing the average speed curve modified by the pre-crash delta, the crash impact was considered complete at the beginning of a period where three five-minute daily speed values were within 3 mph of modified speed curve.    The s ample crash  da ta shown in Figure 2 illustrates i n an id eal situation how the authors attempted t o create t he logic.  A crash occurs at a known time and place.  The first upstream sensor is approxim ately 1. 8 miles away.  The impact visible with the ex treme drops i n s peeds (blue line) is delayed primarily due to the distan ce between the crash and the nearest upstream sensor.  A s imilar i mpact is observed and t he n ext upstream se nsor.  For this c rash, there is no adjusted speed as the period prior to the crash was close to average.  MONTHLY ANALYSIS These rules were applied to the data for o ne month.  The  impacts were estimated for all crashes and the top fifty  impacts were examined in some detail.  The logic appeared to be appropriate for about 47 o f the 50.  The remaining three were situ ations where it was felt a generic logic would not catch the problems.  Therefore, the team is committed to examining the top 50 manually each month to see if there are any that need to be manually adjusted.  For example, one of the top fifty impacts was for a property damage only crash.  Examining the individual crash record revealed that the crash involved a semi that hit a fixed object and blocked one lane of the road in a rural section for several hours.  The logic worked properly.  In another instance, a relatively minor early afternoon crash seemed to have caused delays for the remainder of the day  ¨C traffic never returned above 30 m ph even close to midnight.  A quick examination of the crash data and the reviewers realized the date was February 1, 2011 ¨C the day of a record snowfall in Chicago.  Th is is an example of where the logic was not appropriate, and manual manipulation of the final results was required.   Figure 2 ¨C Sample Crash and Sensor Data 9?? INITIAL NEW REPORTS The Tollway now has a  database with th e impacted time and space for each crash directly identified.  The Tollway and its Traffic Engineer set out to immediately use this new data.    INCIDENT IMPACT As indicated in the literature review, there are different ways to define an incident and its duration.  The Tollway CAD system has very detailed timestamps for when an incident is reported, when units are dispatched, when they arrive, and when they clear themselves from the incident.  Tollway policies and procedures require staff to tim ely report when they arrive, what they are doing, and when they leave the scene, and typically these procedures are adhered to.  But there are always exceptions in real world applications.  While less of an issue today with th e pr eponderance of mobile phones, so metimes in cidents aren¡¯t report for  aw hile.  Sometimes in the interest of safety and traffic, a unit will move off the road to a safe spot on a ramp or at a n oasis to fini sh up paperwork for an incident and forget to notify the CAD dispatchers.  Also, the local fire departments that respond to incidents usually don¡¯t have a compatible radio system and have to rely on their dispatch calling the Tollway dispatch when they leave an incident.  So while measures such as vehicle clearance times, vehicle response times, etc. are good indicators of the speed at which an agency handles an incident, they will also have some inherent weaknesses.    The new method allows the Tollway to directly calculate vehicle hours of delay ¨C recognizing that the logic is not perfect.  Locations and times are known; speed variations from average are known; and the sensors also provide counts during the impacted periods.  Table 1 is used to help identify potentially misappropriated impacts:   Table 1: Vehicle Hours of Delay  SECONDARY ASHES Without a national standard definition of a secondary crash, t he Traffic Eng ineer had been using a simple rule of thumb ¨C within one mile and one hour of another crash.  This rule of thumb had resulted in secondary crashes generally around the 8 % mark.  With the known impact area associated with each crash, the Traffic Engineer could now look only in those impacted areas for additional crashes.  The first method allowed the Tollway to identify those crashes that were very close to another but where traffic had not slowed down.  For instance, the police are on t he shoulder handling a f ender bender when someone is d istracted by the police presence and gets in another crash.  However, the first method does not capture those incidents that have a larger impact.  An analysis of one truck fire crash at the beginning of rush hour several years ago had illustrated five secondary crashes in the hours of delay caused by the closed road.  As the Tollway continues to analyze the data, a hybrid approach may eventually be used.

Figure 3: Secondary Crash Comparison  ASH IMPACTS As stated above, incident response and clearance times can be calculated using data from most CAD systems.  However, the Tollway is also very concerned about minimizing the impact to the traveler.  So the impacts of the crashes are also being reviewed.  Figure 4 illustrates the analysis for the first four months of 2011.  The results show that a full 60% of the crashes have no measureable impact from the sensors.  There still could be a slight impact not near sensors, or that do not fall within the analysis thresholds.  Also, a full 83% of the crashes (60% with zero, 23% less than 10 VPH) have less than 10 vehicle hours of delay associated with the crash.  10 VPH was chosen after illustrating sample impacts at various levels.  10 VPH was selected as something that would be viewed by motorists as minimal impact.     020406080100120Jan?'10Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan?'11Feb Mar AprNumber?of?Secondary?CrashesSecondary?Crashes?by?Month?(2010©\2011)Method?1:?1?Mile,?1?Hour Method?2:?Impact?Areas11?? Figure 4: Distribution of Crashes by Impact  CONCLUSION This effort began with a short question, but grew in complexity the more it was studied.  The intent was not to create r eports f or their own sak e, bu t to identify useful reports an d performance measures that the Tollway expects to utilize in improving incident management and operations, and answering question posed by the public and management.    The existing reports are already in active use by the Tollway.  Many of the potential short term reports are being studied and expected to be implemented in the coming months or years.  Each will be reviewed in annual p rogramming to d etermine their value and potential for implementation.    This effort has ill ustrated the need for continuing research and development in these topics.  The To llway, while often finding itself on  th e cutting edge, is grou nded in  day  to day  management and operations.  Each of these reports and measures is based on real world data; those that are not re adily calculated with a ctual or n ear term have been shelved for now.  Nevertheless, the Tollway will continue to look for ways to improve reporting capabilities and to monitor improvements and refinements to these reports throughout the industry.    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The corresponding author would like t o thank the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority for providing the opportunity to work on these measures that are so  critical to th e successful operations of the Illinois Tollway as well as the advancement of operations across the industry.  12??Additionally, significant work was completed on the speed profiles used in many of these reports by TranSmart Technologies.

1  A Study on the Consistent Methods & Field Conditions for Performance Evaluation to Vehicle Detecting System   Yoon-Mi Shin ITS Korea #604, Daerung Technotown 15, 224-5 Gwanyang-2dong, Dongan-gu Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, 431-062 Tel: +82-31-478-0400 / Fax: +82-31-478-0490 E-mail: rfshin@itskorea.kr     Key Words: PE(Performance Evaluation), VDS(Vehicle Detecting System)    ABSTRACT  Recently, Korea has enforced the ITS performance evaluation for the field systems such as vehicle detecting system(VDS) and automatic vehicle identification(AVI) system that directly affect the quality of traffic information. The quality and accuracy of ITS equipment are closely related to traffic information in field, ITS management through ITS performance evaluation is needed to increase reliability of ITS traffic information and to maximize investment.  Therefore, for providing efficient management of ITS performance evaluation, it is necessary to prepare the standard methods and countermeasure that may occur in exceptional cases based on field conditions  In this study, I propose some guideline to providing consistent evaluation of Vehicle Detecting System for data analysis and installation point selection according to field conditions.   2  INTRODUCTION  The Ministry of Land, Transportation and Maritime Affairs (MLTMA) developed a system of evaluation criteria in 2005 and established the "ITS Performance Evaluation Outlines" and started evaluation and certification for field equipment such as vehicle detectors in 2008 after a pilot operation period. KICT(Korea institute of construction Technology), KEC(Korea Expressway Corporation) and ITS Korea have been assigned as "ITS Performance Evaluation Institute Accredited by MLTMA" on the basis of "ITS Guidelines" and "ITS Business Guidelines". ITS performance evaluation is a case of calibrations by evaluation the accuracy of the ITS equipment. The goals of ITS performance evaluation are to maintain the capabilities and performance of ITS equipment, to improve the quality of traffic information and to obtain the efficiency of Quality Management. Most of current ITS¡¯s are compiling point information of field from Vehicle Detecting System (VDS) and the accuracy of traffic information of the section concerned is decided depending on the performance level of the VDS. In this regard, it is necessary to review various road situations and the evaluation method pursuant to the environment and to arrange the environmental factors required to implement more effective ITS performance evaluation. That guidelines should be provided for the ITS project with planning and building concept through regular training. The guidelines suggest how to avoid exceptional cases, and it is possible to help to improve the performance evaluation accuracy.   OUTLINE OF ITS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  ITS performance evaluation is a case of calibrations by evaluation the accuracy of the ITS equipment. The goals of ITS performance evaluation are to maintain the capabilities and performance of ITS equipment, to improve the quality of traffic information and to obtain the efficiency of Quality Management.  3  ITS performance evaluation is comprised of Performance inspection before the completion of construction and Regular inspection, the target for evaluation and the scope of which are as the below table.   Table 1 ¨C Summary of ITS performance evaluation  Categories Scopes of evaluation Targets of evaluation (Evaluation Items) Performance inspection before the completion of construction Inspect the performance of roadway-based equipment before the completion of construction VDS ; Vehicle Detection System(the average spot speed and traffic Volume) AVI ; Automatic Vehicle Identification(rate of number plate recognition) Regular inspection Inspect the performance of roadway-based equipment every 2 years  VDS evaluation items are traffic volume(traffic Volume), speed(speed), and evaluation method is using "100(%)-MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentage Error)". The evaluation target equipment must meet "superior class" in the level of accuracy except for special case. AVI evaluation item is the rate of number plate recognition, evaluation method is using "100(%)-PE(Percentage Error)". The evaluation target equipment must meet "superior class" in the level of accuracy except for special case. The performance evaluation results should be at least at the level of superior class(VDS at 90% or more, AVI at 80% or more) to receive acceptance notification.  Table 2 ¨C Class of performance for ITS performance evaluation  Class of performance Requirement VDS : "100(%)-MAPE" AVI : "100(%)-PE" superlative ¡Ý 95% ¡Ý 95% superior ¡Ý 90% ¡Ý 85% intermediate ¡Ý 80% ¡Ý 80% pre-intermediate <  80% <  80% 4  CASE STUDIES OF FIELD CONDITIONS FOR VDS(VIDEO IMAGE DETECTOR TYPE)   In accordance with the road situation which is getting more and more complicated, ITS equipments are being installed to diversified places, and the result of performance evaluation the equipments will affect the accuracy of traffic information. The result of performance evaluation of video image type VDS is largely influenced depending on the installation places and their directions of video cameras as well as the process setting of camera image system.  The following are the summary of cases where the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated depending on the installation environment of video image type VDS in urban area.  Table 3 ¨C Installation environment in urban area where the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated.   Installation environment Influence to the result of performance evaluation Vicinity of Bus stops - Due to the stopping of buses, the number of lane changing vehicles nearby is increased and thus the number of vehicles which are excluded from performance evaluation are increasing. - The more vehicles are excluded from performance evaluation, the more accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated. U-turn area - Due to U turns of vehicles, changing lanes are done often and thus the number of vehicles excluded from performance evaluation is increased, which results in the deterioration of the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation. Junction area - As changing lanes are done frequently, the number of vehicles excluded from performance evaluation is increased and thus the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated. 5  Entrance/exit point - The number of vehicles excluded from performance evaluation is increased at entrance/exit points where changing lanes are done frequently, which results in the deterioration of the accuracy of performance evaluation Heavy parking and stopping area - If the number of vehicles which interfere the traffic flow of vicinity lanes is increased due to parking and stopping of vehicles, the number of vehicles excluded from performance evaluation is increased and thus the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated.  Area with not-uniform lanes - In case a lane is wider compared to other lanes, vehicles in vicinity lanes violate lanes and the cases of excluding the vehicles from performance evaluation are increasing, which results in the deterioration of accuracy of the result of performance evaluation.    Vicinity of Bus stop:  Over detection was occurred due to the increase of lane changing vehicles U-turn area (Nighttime evaluation):  Accurate evaluation is difficult to achieve due to increase in lane violation by vehicles taking U-turns.   Junction area:  Difficult to evaluate vicinity lane of junction area due to the increase of lane crossing vehicles Entrance/exit area:  Traffic is not normally done due to the entrance/exit to construction site and thus it is impossible to evaluate the most outer lane. 6  Heavy parking and stopping area:  Impossible to evaluate lanes in both ways due to the parked and stopped vehicles Area with not-uniform lanes:  The accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated due to lane violation at vicinity lanes.  Figure 1 ¨C Example of installation environment picture in urban area where the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated   The following are the summary of failure factors, failure inducing conditions and performance enhancement methods for video image type VDS:  Table 4 ¨C Failure factors for video image type VDS pursuant to evaluation conditions   Failure factors Failure inducing evaluation conditions Over detection - Shadows of vehicles in vicinity lanes are recognized as vehicles in the evaluation lane. - One large size long vehicle is recognized as two vehicles (Duplicated detection) - When a large size high top vehicle is passing at the vicinity lane, it is recognized as a vehicle in the evaluation lane (In case camera was installed at the position which blocks the evaluation lane when high top vehicle is passing in the vicinity lane). - A same vehicle is recognized two times due to traffic jam (Duplicated detection).  - Detection area was wrongly set to recognize the vehicle in the vicinity lane as the one in the evaluation lane. - At the time of nighttime evaluation, head light of a vehicle in the vicinity lane is recognized as a vehicle in the evaluation lane. 7  - At the time of nighttime evaluation, head light of the evaluation vehicle is recognized as a evaluation vehicle in addition to the recognition of the vehicle itself (Thus double detection).  - A vehicle was not passed actually but it is recognized as if a vehicle was passed.  No detection - Due to traffic jam, a vehicle driving very close to other vehicle is not recognized (Following vehicle is recognized as the same vehicle and therefore detection is not made. Especially small size vehicle closely following behind a bus is not recognized usually). - A vehicle in dark color is recognized as a shadow of other vehicle and therefore the vehicle is not recognized as an evaluation vehicle. - Detection area was wrongly set and therefore vehicle in the evaluation lane is not detected. - At the time of nighttime evaluation, very weak head light makes it impossible to be recognized as an evaluation vehicle.  - At the time of nighttime evaluation, a vehicle in dark color cannot be recognized. Unusual speed - In case accurate speed calculation is impossible due to traffic jam or problem in speed calculation process.   Table 5 ¨C Performance improvement methods by failure factor of video image type VDS  Failure factor Performance improvement methods Over detection - Adjustment of camera angle (Resetting of camera installation position) - Resetting of detection area, adjustment of detection sensitivity and review of detection process. No detection - Adjustment of detection sensitivity and review of detection process - Resetting of detection area and checking of camera operation status Unusual speed - Review of speed calculation process   The failure factors of video image type VDS can be reduced through resetting of detection area, the management of detection sensitivity, the adjustment of camera angle (Resetting of camera installation position) and process review.  Generally, differently from daytime evaluation, it is a tendency of nighttime evaluation that 8  the accuracy of the result of evaluation is based on considerable influence depending on the condition of maintenance such as the picture quality and angle of camera image (Intensity of illumination, cleanness state). Major failure factors from the performance evaluation as a result of ITS Korea¡¯s video image type VDS performance evaluation conducted in 2011 in urban area were mainly attributed by over detections due to the vehicles in vicinity lanes and the shadows of vicinity vehicles while all pass rate was shown after taking measure for performance improvement.   Figure 2 ¨C Failure factor ratio in performance evaluation (2011, ITS Korea)  And in case evaluation point is near from bus stop and entrance/exit point, the cases where speed evaluation and traffic volume evaluation of the lane concerned were excluded were approximately 12% while conditional performance evaluation excluding the evaluation of the lane concerned was conducted.    Figure 3 ¨C Conditional performance evaluation ratio pursuant to surrounding environment in urban area (2011, ITS Korea) 9   At the time of installing video image type VDS in urban area, the VDS will have to be installed considering the surrounding environment in order to compile more accurate traffic information and the installation environment which was presented in this thesis will have to be avoided in selecting evaluation points.  CONCLUSIONS  This thesis analyzed the installation environment which affected the performance evaluation of video image type VDS and its failure factors at the time of analyzing the result and discussed on the method which could enhance the performance. At the time of selecting evaluation points, installation environment in urban area which affects the result of evaluation should be avoided while taking actions for performance improvement based on the analysis of failure points from the result of evaluation and for conducting reevaluation.  The failure factors and the methods for performance improvement pursuant to the installation environment and evaluation conditions in urban area presented in this thesis where the accuracy of the result of performance evaluation is deteriorated may be presented as important guidelines for performance evaluation while serving important index to make video image type VDS performance evaluation as consistent evaluation. The failure factors pursuant to these diversified installation environment and evaluation conditions should be presented as a guideline at the stage of ITS design so that unnecessary investment can be reduced and more accurate traffic information can be obtained.  We are in the opinion that the establishment of a guideline using the factors which can affect the result of performance evaluation presented by situation in this thesis will contribute to the quality of performance evaluation and further more the enhancement of quality of traffic information as well. We can expect the effect of improvement in the enhancement of accuracy if aggressive post control and performance improvement of VDS is done. The installation states of video image type VDS are different depending on diversified road situation, and accordingly the accuracy of traffic information will be considerably affected by the installation state. As the level of data accuracy of field equipments is directly connected 10  with the accuracy of traffic information right away, the reduction of not efficient equipments will also have important significance in whole traffic information.

1??THE CASE FOR EARLY FREIGHT AND TRANSIT CONNECTED VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT   James Misener Booz Allen Hamilton 101 California St, Suite 3300, San Francisco CA 94111 +1-415-627-3322, Misener_James@bah.com  Matthew Dorfman D¡¯Artagnan Consulting LLP 4700 9th St. S, Arlington VA 22204 +1-703-892-1716, mdorfman@alum.mit.edu  Joseph Averkamp Booz Allen Hamilton 8283 Greensboro Dr., McLean VA 22102 +1-703-377-0400, Averkamp_Joseph@bah.com   ABSTRACT Early connected vehicle infrastructure deployment should focus on freight and transit applications. That is because freight and transit deployment will be an acceptable use of taxpayer dollars, because freight and transit deployment will rapidly benefit all transportation system users, and because there are several applications for freight and transit that can be rapidly developed for commercial deployment. This paper will argue that freight and transit should be the primary focus for early connected vehicle deployment.  INTRODUCTION Given adoption, progressive deployment and subsequent befits of connected vehicle technologies with commercial and transit vehicles, a case could be made that light duty passenger vehicles, or the preponderance of the surface vehicle fleet, would leverage off the installed base of communicating buses, trucks and infrastructure roadside equipment (RSE) at intersections.  One cannot conclusively prove this hypothesis, but independent, compelling cases for freight- and transit-based kernels of deployment can be made.  Freight and transit connected vehicle deployment may find receptivity even in a public skeptical of new uses of taxpayer dollars. Many members of driving public are apprehensive about driving close to or passing freight vehicles. This concern is justified: approximately 7% (1) road fatalities involve heavy commercial vehicles. Therefore, connected vehicle safety applications will give drivers a greater sense of security. Another reason for the acceptability of freight deployment is the fact that freight vehicles account for a disproportionate amount 2??of traffic on roads:  large trucks vehicles make up about 4% of the US vehicle fleet and about 7% of vehicle miles traveled (1). A final reason is that deploying OBUs to freight vehicles will happen rapidly once a benefit can be demonstrated. Freight carriers are driven by a business case. If there is a proven benefit to connected vehicle technologies, they will adopt¡ªnot only in new vehicles, but also in retrofitting existing freight vehicles.  Transit vehicles have different ownership and operating models, and the dynamic and decision-making are quite different.  However, there are some similarities.  Transit agencies still procure and operate fleets with objective criteria, and vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity can achieve operational efficiencies and therefore benefit those agencies. Standards-based and open communication channels can provide automatic vehicle location, transit signal priority, pedestrian safety and other applications.  Importantly, a typical transit deployment is where the buses mostly run on fixed routes ¨C in heavily-traveled arterials and primary roads with signalized traffic control.  These are generally the very same routes which could benefit from arterial connected vehicle safety applications, and in particular Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance Systems (CICAS), where signal phase and timing and a local dynamic map are broadcast along each intersection approach (2).  Given adoption, progressive deployment and subsequent benefits of connected vehicle technologies with commercial and transit vehicles, a case could be made that light duty passenger vehicles, or the preponderance of the surface vehicle fleet, would leverage off the installed base of communicating buses, trucks and infrastructure roadside equipment (RSE) at intersections. One cannot conclusively prove this hypothesis, but independent, compelling cases for freight- and transit-based kernels of deployment can be made.  THE CASE FOR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES By and large, national commercial carriers procure fleet enhancements and rolling stock in large quantities, based on economic factors.  This objective, business-focused view makes these commercial fleets perfectly suited for connected vehicle deployment.  If a carrier can calculate benefit and reduction in operating costs from mobility or safety enhancements, to include those from connected vehicles, that carrier will make the purchase.  Even if both technology costs and per-unit benefits are modest, but the amortized return on investment is positive, purchasing the innovation is justified even if it is not dramatic.  All that is needed is that the benefits be justifiable and scalable across the affected fleet.  In short, the commercial vehicle decision-makers should be confident in connected vehicles, technically, operationally and institutionally.    The USDOT connected vehicle research program is working to establish such confidence.  Furthermore, through concerted policy decisions, connected commercial vehicles could provide one of the two foundational elements for large-scale and initial deployment.  Consider that there are 15.5 million Class 3 ¨C 8 trucks on the road, with 90 percent operated as not as owner/operators but in fleets, i.e., those probably operating under the objective business principles described above (3).  This diversity of commercial vehicle classes means that there are a diversity of commercial uses, across all road types from residential and secondary through limited access highways.    3?? Consider also the very real concerns that fleet dispatch and operation are proprietary and also that there are established wireless carriers, companies, systems and services that provide some of this type of dispatch and operational logistics.  There are existing wireless data links are via cellular modem, with voice links through a variety of means to include everyday commercial wireless services. Where in this figurative spectrum are the opportunities for the connected vehicle?    Enter Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), filling the void beneath the longer range over-the-air communication range.  Comprising the edge of the network, DSRC is logically and conventionally considered the real-time, low-latency safety-of-life link.  While there are undisputed safety benefits that may arise from widespread deployment of safety services to fleets, there are at this time simply too many untested ¡°actors¡± to consider from the diversity of owners and operators of the road and the plethora of traffic control devices to justify large-scale deployment.   The question to ask, then, is can the fleet be the star protagonist? Indeed it can.  The fleet can also derive benefit and provide the important seeds of deployment to other road users, to include the road owner/operator.  An essential starting point is the concept of a Trusted Fleet, a new institutional concept where good citizen fleets have some of the relay and public key encryption privileges of an emergency vehicle and a roadside unit (RSE).  The salient arguments for this concept include:  1. A primary benefit would be to allow a Trusted Fleet participant to relay DSRC messages, either from other vehicles or from the infrastructure or to create a ¡°mini-Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET),¡± a mesh network incorporating roadside infrastructure and vehicles.  The prospect of rogue participants has obviated serious consideration of VANET in the current USDOT connected vehicle program, but a Trusted Fleet takes on these elements, effectively extending the range of nearby vehicle messages.  In some urban scenarios, use of commercial vehicles as VANET elements could drastically reduce the need for RSEs to only those at critical high crash concentration intersections.  Commercial vehicles are perfect elements of a trusted fleet because they typically have secure communications to their dispatch centers, enabling certificate management and revocation. That same vehicle can accumulate and locally broadcast traveler information such as link speeds, which it would obtain from a traffic analytics application).  Commercial vehicles generally have a high physical profile (over 10 feet) so its DSRC antenna would likely be able to maximize its broadcast range.  The fleet operator would benefit because this by-link aggregated mobility could give accurate travel times, particularly when links are put together for total trip time.  2. Commercial vehicles could broadcast their speeds, allowing nearby cars to acquire real-time link travel times. While commercial vehicles often do not travel at the rate of free flow traffic, their speeds are usually a lower bound for that speed.   Granted, there are businesses that operate by aggregating and reporting commercial vehicle speeds, a for-the-public-good model would be to broadcast individual commercial vehicle speeds via DSRC, or only to the segment or link the particular vehicle travels.    4??3. There are also a set of other applications.  None of these are mutually exclusive, and the list is not exhaustive. Each of these applications may have positive carrier and societal benefit.     a. Wireless roadside inspection¡ªvehicle data buses can be read out remotely, eliminating the need for some manual vehicle inspections and allowing many more vehicles to be inspected. b. Drayage reduction¡ªby increasing knowledge of cargo container location and facilitating information exchanges between cargo carriers, many movements of unloaded vehicles can be eliminated, taking traffic off the road in congested freight hubs such as Chicago. c. Geo-fencing¡ªcommercial vehicles containing hazardous materials can be better tracked and notified of areas where they are not permitted to go if a so-called geo-fencing application is running on their OBUs. d. ¡°No Zone¡± (blind spot) protection¡ªcommercial vehicles have larger blind spots than light vehicles, and driving in these blind spots leads to increased risk of accident; an application notifying the commercial vehicle driver of vehicles in the blind spot will greatly increase commercial vehicle safety. e. Precursor to automation¡ªby providing a secure low-latency data link for vehicles, the technological basis is installed that could one day lead to automation of vehicles.  The potential benefits for each of these is quite significant, and where all these applications materialize, the sum could be quite a compelling argument for freight-led deployment, irrespective of the benefits that would accrue were cars to begin deploying connectivity, thereby addressing the a compelling reason for vehicle connectivity across classes:  to address passenger vehicle-truck crashes.  THE CASE FOR TRANSIT VEHICLES Deployment of connected vehicle systems on transit vehicles carries unique benefits. One benefit is that any infrastructure that addresses transit needs will address light duty vehicle needs, so transit could be the seed for V2I applications.  Transit systems utilize high density, fixed urban routes. Transit vehicles generally travel where passenger car density and congestion is the highest. RSEs installed for transit can be used to support a significant amount of light duty, passenger vehicle applications whenever they are not being used for transit.   Moreover, the aforementioned transit signal priority enabled by the standards- based DSRC and not by proprietary communication links would provide a case for RSE at signalized traffic signal equipment at the roadside and it would also enable CICAS, certainly for transit buses; however, because CICAS applies to all modes, this safety service would be applied to and benefit other modes as well.  A second benefit is that transit vehicles on congested corridors travel with several minute headways, particularly during peak hours.  This will lead to the development of new safety applications that can be used by everyone.  Transit systems currently employ multiple, incompatible proprietary ¡°blackbox¡± automatic vehicle location systems; connected vehicles will provide a platform for a integrated non-proprietary development of applications for transit vehicles, which will lead to better applications at lower cost, benefitting transit agencies. 5?? SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Early deployment of freight and transit connected vehicle technologies has unique benefits for the entire connected vehicle program. One benefit is that if many retrofits of commercial vehicles occur rapidly at the start of the program, a large installed base of connected vehicle-capable vehicles will be created. With this installed base, drivers of light passenger vehicles will experience immediate benefits by upgrading to connected vehicle technologies in their vehicles. They will notice safety benefits every time they drive close to a commercial vehicle. This will in turn encourage drivers of light duty vehicles to retrofit their vehicles or to upgrade to new vehicles with connected vehicle technology.   A second benefit is that commercial and transit vehicles will be rapidly and economically be able to install connected vehicle OBUs that collect vital vehicular data such as temperature, windshield wiper status, and headlight status. These data can then be collected and used to generate localized data on road and weather conditions in a much more precise way than has been done before.    A final benefit is that commercial and transit vehicles all have high costs¡ªmuch higher than the costs of light vehicles. These high costs mean that the incremental costs to add an OBU are smaller than for a lower-cost light vehicle. Small incremental costs mean that the commercial carriers are more likely to deploy the equipment promptly once the benefits are demonstrated.   Deployment of connected vehicle technologies¡ªboth roadside and on-board¡ªshould focus on early deployment to commercial and transit fleets. Deployment should include light vehicles simultaneously too. The focus on commercial and transit vehicles will aid in the uptake of the technologies for light vehicles and increase the safety and mobility benefits of the entire connected vehicle system.

-1-  THE IMPACT OF A NON-VIOLATION BUSINESS MODEL ON A GREENFIELD ALL ELECTRONIC TOLL (AET) OPERATIONS  Matthew Russell Systems and Data Analyst, Egis Projects Canada 101-12165 Harris Road Pitt Meadows, BC V3Y2E9 1-604-460-5027, mrussell@egiscanada.ca  ABSTRACT Analysis was done on the business rules, account demographics and travel data of the Golden Ears Bridge (GEB): a Greenfield All Electronic Toll (AET) bridge in Metro Vancouver, Canada opened in 2009. It was discovered that a non-violation post paid business model creates a high number of infrequent users from a wide-geographical area; but that over time a trend exists whereby infrequent users become more frequent, thereby increasing redistributed traffic.    DISCUSSION The Golden Ears Bridge (GEB) is a Greenfield All Electronic Toll (AET) bridge, which opened for operations in April 2009 (tolling from July 2009).The AET system is an open road tolling system with no barriers, providing free flowing high-speed traffic and no toll booths. Tolls are collected either by reading a transponder located within the vehicle or by performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on license plates. Customers can pay for their tolls before or after crossing via the web or a customer service center located locally. Collection enforcement comes from restricting access to new or renewed provincial government-controlled driver and vehicle licensing.  The bridge was considered a community bridge, in that it provided a link between two communities previously separated by water (cutting journey time by up to an hour). The bridge also provides an alternative to Highway 1, the main route into Vancouver, which is prone to heavy traffic. Due to travel links between the joining communities being so poor prior to the opening of the GEB, it was expected that there would be minimal diverted traffic (39% expected in year 1) with the majority of traffic (61%) coming from redistributed journeys1.  From this, three core beliefs emerged: 1. It is necessary to encourage redistributed traffic 2. Most users will be local and therefore there is an opportunity for them to become frequent users 3. Frequent users will want to pay the lowest possible fare  From these core beliefs emerged a business model that had the following characteristics: -2-  1. There are no violations; everybody is treated as a customer - to encourage traffic redistribution. 2. There is no requirement to pre-register or pre-pay  - to encourage traffic redistribution. 3. Registered customers enjoy lower fares - to encourage registration. With no other current toll operations in the area, an opportunity arose to develop a tolling culture distinct from the pre-paid violation model commonplace elsewhere in the world. By having a post-paid model with no violations, the hope was to encourage infrequent users to ¡®try out¡¯ the bridge and explore their neighboring community in the hope that they will become frequent users over time, thereby encouraging traffic redistribution. The lack of a pre-payment requirement enabled customers to decide how they preferred to manage their toll account. Although out of scope of this research, it is interesting to note that at the time writing, 99.4% of current accounts are post-paid, showing that the market in this region has a definite preference for the post-paid account management model.  By the end of the first year of operations, over 573k accounts had been created, 76% of which were unregistered (customers who travelled the bridge without pre-registering their vehicle).  Despite their majority in account share, these non-registered accounts accounted for only 36% of transactions (figure 2).  Figure 2: Registration breakdown after one year of tolling  June-July 2010 Registered Non-registered Accounts created 134,920 24% 438,532 76% Monthly Transactions 460,155 64% 253,990 36%   With a high percentage of unregistered customers sharing the minority of transactions, non-registered customers were shown to be far more infrequent users of the bridge than registered customers. Indeed it is a consistent statistic during the first two years of operations that an active unregistered customer uses the bridge an average of 3 times per month, compared to 9 times for a registered customer. This should be expected, because if a customer uses the bridge more often there will be a greater incentive for them to register and receive the lower fares. The surprise came from the fact that with just over 150,000 in the local population, why were there so many infrequent users of this community bridge?  Analysis shows that 23% of GEB users live within 10km of the bridge, but they account for more than 56% of the traffic. The majority of the remaining traffic comes from up to 50km away, which is about the radius of the Greater Vancouver Region (GVR). The large number of non-local users could be due to a number of factors:  ¡þ The GEB provides an alternative route to the sometimes heavy traffic on Highway 1 ¡þ The mountains on the north side of the bridge represent an opportunity for tourism ¡þ The looks, span and nature of the bridge makes crossing it a recreational activity -3-   With so many infrequent users coming from outside the local area, it is questionable whether or not we would still observe the expected trend of infrequent users becoming frequent over time as traffic redistribution occurs. If it is true that infrequent usage generates redistributed traffic, then the percentage share of unregistered accounts, and the number of transactions they account for, should decrease over time as users become more frequent and register to enjoy the savings.   Figure 3: Unregistered users and transactions over two years of operations  - shown in 6 month periods Unregistered Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Users 85% 78% 74% 69% Transactions 46% 35% 32% 27%  Figure 3 demonstrates that despite the high number of infrequent users from outside the local area, we still observe the expected decline of unregistered users and their transaction share over the first two years of operations. During the first six months of tolling unregistered users accounted for 85% of users and 46% of traffic, but by the first half of 2011 this had fallen to 69% and 27% respectively. This is despite an AADT increase from 20k -28k during the same period. This shows some support for the expected trend: that the non-violation business model encourages infrequent users, which in turn drives traffic redistribution and subsequent conversion to registered accounts.   Further support for the expected trend comes from analyzing the source of registered account opening.  Figure 4 shows that 71% of registered accounts were converted from non-registered accounts. This means that as traffic redistribution occurs, customers begin to use the bridge more often and in turn register to enjoy the savings. Please note that the lower percentage of transponder accounts converted form unregistered is due to the fact that over 30% of transponder accounts were opened before tolling began.  Figure 4: Percentage of current registered accounts converted from non-registered accounts   Registration Type Total Accounts # Converted % Transponder registered 47,192 18,294 39% Video registered 114,113 96,414 84% Total Registered 161,305 114,708 71%   CONCLUSION  In conclusion, the business model on the GEB deliberately encourages infrequent users in order to drive redistributed traffic. Users can travel across the bridge without pre-registering and -4-  without pre-paying. The only disincentive to not pre-registering comes from a slightly higher toll rate (15-30% for a car, depending on whether or not a transponder is used). There is no disincentive to not pre-paying, leading to 99.4% of customers choosing a post-paid account.   Initially the lack of a pre-registration requirement meant that there were a high number of infrequent unregistered users. However over the two year period a trend has existed for a move toward a more frequent registered-user customer base.  The following key findings were observed:  1. There were more non-registered users than expected for a community bridge 2. A large number of the infrequent users live outside the local area 3. Non-registered customers are less frequent users of the bridge than registered customers 4. Over time, as traffic redistribution occurs, there is a gradual trend for non-registered customers to become registered users, to take advantage of lower fares   REFERENCES 1 Steer Davies Gleave, 2004, New Fraser River Crossing: Traffic and Revenue Forecasts

Page	1	 The	Future	of	511:	Revenue	Generation	A	Sustainable	Solution	to	Providing	a	511	System	in	a	Low/No	Cost	Environment	 Matt Hamill Executive VP & COO, Global-5 Communications The	511	System	Today	The 511 system has evolved substantially from its original mission ¨C delivering travel-related weather information via telephone ¨C into a full-featured travel information system, offering real-time information about:  ¡þ Travel ¡þ Traffic ¡þ Construction ¡þ Toll roads ¡þ Mass transit schedules, routes, fares and park-and-ride lots ¡þ Amber/Silver Alerts and homeland security alerts  ¡þ  Carpool, vanpool and ride-share ¡þ Tourism  ¡þ Trip planning ¡þ Bicycling information  All this information is available via a growing variety of new modalities:  ¡þ Short message system (SMS) text ¡þ Interactive voice recognition (IVR)  ¡þ Social media ¡þ Mobile phone applications ¡þ Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) ¡þ 511 Web Site ¡þ Email   Add in the burdens of data collection from traffic cameras, roadside sensors, and the like, and 511costs are skyrocketing as travelers expect more and more services delivered relevantly.  Today, 511 providers primary mission remains to provide all 511 users with accurate and reliable real-time travel information to make the best decisions about when and where to travel. However, many states struggle with supporting a data- and funding-intensive service with often uncertain funding streams.  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) projects like 511 must compete with other transportation projects which receive funding from the gas tax. ITS projects are relatively new to most states and, unlike building a road, they are for the most part unseen or unnoticed by the traveling public.   A relatively new idea¡þsponsor-based revenue generation programs¡þoffers a way out of the funding dilemma for 511 operators.   Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved. 	 Page	2	 What	is	Revenue	Generation?	Revenue generation programs involve offering private sector sponsors brand building opportunities that appear on 511 assets such as:   ¡þ Freeway/Interstate Signs ¡þ Welcome messages on IVR ¡þ 511 Web sites ¡þ Personalized Services  This sponsorship model generates revenue by offering a company an exclusive opportunity to ¡°sponsor¡± the 511 program. The sponsor can also promote 511 to their customers, increasing awareness and usage of the system. As an added benefit, 511 roadside signs can generate revenue while raising awareness of 511 services among travelers.  As budget shortfalls continue, the public seems to be ready to accept 511 sponsorship. Statewide 511 focus group participants surveyed by Dr. James Wright of the University of Central Florida in 2008 indicated they would support the use of advertising to continue receiving free 511 information. In fact, this type of sponsorship follows a proven model ¡ªTurnpike and Road Ranger programs have had private sector sponsorship for years. As a bonus, important job creation by 511 programs would be evident right along the roadside¡ª as crews work to install sponsored signs.   It¡¯s no wonder that many 511 system operators are interested in revenue generation programs. In a Global-5 informal survey conducted of 511 Working Group attendees and other 511 managers and consultants in late 2010, 80 percent said they were either considering or were seeking to learn more about 511 revenue generation. That only 1 percent of the respondents were actually generating revenue despite this intense interest indicates that revenue generation is a leading edge concept.  This paper will take the mystery out of revenue generation and help you understand if a revenue generation program is in your future. Advantages	of	Revenue	Generation	Besides the obvious advantage of having more money to maintain and enhance your 511 system, a revenue program for 511 system owners keeps you in control¡þwith a continuous funding stream your system will no longer struggle to maintain or increase funding.   ¡þ You own the relationship with advertisers/sponsors ¡þ You maintain control of your system  ¡þ You maintain control of your right-of-way ¡þ Your transparent approach creates public goodwill and maximizes revenue Figure 1¡þA Prototype Sponsorship Example for a 511 Website   Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved. 	 Page	3	 Revenue	Example	So what might a typical revenue generation program look like? The obvious answer is: it depends. It depends on what your traffic numbers are. It depends on the number of metropolitan areas you have that can support interested sponsors. It depends on a number of regulatory and statute limitations.  As illustration, let¡¯s take a hypothetical example of a state with a robust transportation system and many urban centers:  ¡þ Assume $12,000 annual revenue per sign¡þGlobal-5 projects the average revenue per sign will between $9,000 and $12,000 per year depending on annual average daily traffic (AADT) and based on advertising industry norms    ¡þ Let¡¯s say you sell sponsorships for 600 signs¡þIt will obviously take time to reach this number ¡þ That¡¯s an annual revenue of $7.2 million ¡þ BUT: Costs are substantial¡þfor sign installation, maintenance, sponsorship sales and program administration In this example, given these assumptions, we project that for the average program, by Year 4 or 5, revenue exceeds costs and revenue generation is typically strong.    Determining	Sponsorship	Costs	So how do you set the price for sponsorship of your various 511 assets? The most straightforward way is to use established advertising industry average rates¡ªrates that your sponsors should be readily familiar with if they do any other advertising.  Advertising is usually based on Cost Per Thousand of impressions (CPM).1 An impression is one person being exposed to an ad once. You can calculate how many people will see a sponsored sign by taking the AADT and assuming 1.67 people per car.2 Let¡¯s take the example of a Right-of-Way (ROW) sign on a very high-traffic highway like I-405 in Los Angeles where the AADT is 300,000. While the typical CPM for an advertising billboard is $1-$5, we use 43 cents for sponsored ROW signs. You can calculate the value of that sign as:  AADT * 365 *1.67 *.43 / 1,000 = 300,000 * 365 * 1.67 * .43 / 1000 or $78,632 annual sponsorship  The LA example is obviously the high end of the range. If we take a ROW sign on I-71 in rural Ohio with an AADT of 20,000, the calculation looks like this:  20,000 * 365 * 1.67 * .43 / 1000 or $5,242 annual sponsorship  Of course, your state projections¡ªbased on traffic counts and the CPM established for other advertising¡ªmay be VERY different!                                                       1 For more information about measuring out of home advertising, see the Traffic Audit Bureau¡¯s Website: http://www.tabonline.com 2 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS): http://bit.ly/opsN1T   Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved. 	 Page	4	 Existing	Revenue	Generation	Efforts	Massachusetts, Georgia, and Los Angeles are all piloting revenue generation programs. It is too early to say how successful these programs will be, however. Multiple states do at least some turnpike advertising with some success. California and Pennsylvania are asking the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to allow digital advertising on dynamic message signs, which may open up more revenue opportunities.  States considering 511 revenue generation should plan on coordinating with other state partners, sponsors and the public to:  ¡þ Guarantee transparency¡ªBeing open about the rationale and goals of your sponsorship program will generate goodwill with the public and sponsors ¡þ Mitigate conflicts between sponsors and your department¡ªHead off problems caused by misunderstandings ¡þ Allow you to establish consistent policies and rates based on AADT counts ¡þ Generate maximum revenue for the state/owner Legal	Issues	Current FHWA guidelines state that any revenue generated by roadside signs must go back to support the program. However, in some regions, roadside sign placement and revenue may have to be coordinated and shared with other government agencies, complicating revenue programs.  FHWA will allow sponsorship in the ROW but not advertising.  What is the difference you ask? Sponsorship is primarily a branding campaign: The logo or brand of the sponsor is visible but there is no call to action. Advertising involves a call to action: 1/2 off Tuesdays, Buy One Get One Free, 99 cents for a Limited Time,  and so on.  California is a good example of revenue generation programs that require legislative action to succeed. California legislators are being asked to grant permission to allow advertising on digital license tags. The California DOT would oversee the program, and revenue generated will subsidize the 511 system. Other	Issues	¡þ Accepting sponsors for 511 entails some risk of losing agency credit for producing and delivering the information provided¡þThe sponsor may be seen as the provider ¡þ Public perception about advertising on state programs within the right-of-way may not be favorable or the state may be seen as favoring specific commercial enterprises over others¡þAgencies need to be proactive in managing this perception ¡þ The revenue program may not deliver sufficient revenue to cover 511 expenses, the revenue projections may be inaccurate or overly optimistic ¡þAgencies need to be conservative and watch what is promised ¡þ Be certain you can do it if you¡¯re going it alone¡þAgencies often have little experience in selling sponsorships, receiving and tracking revenue, and dealing with the private sector.  ¡þ Distracted driving concerns may escalate¡þSafety experts already warn of this issue, and it¡¯s one that digital billboards have had to overcome. State officials or the public could become sufficiently concerned to alter the program.   Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved. 	 Page	5	 	Caveats	Providers of 511 services need to ensure that adopting revenue generation does not degrade service to the users of 511. Providing a robust, ever improving 511 system will encourage sponsors to stay engaged and continue to support the program.  Adopting a revenue generation program means investing in marketing program development and administration, including advertising guidelines. You can¡¯t just hang out a shingle and hope that the right sponsors will beat a path to your door.  Key concepts in any sponsorship program are quality assurance and control over the message. Sponsor placements must be appealing, professional and reflect well on the 511 provider. They also must present a positive and relevant message that will be welcomed by the target audience. Implementing	a	Revenue	Program	Before you can create a revenue program, you need to inventory your assets. Develop an audit of ITS assets and assess whether each is appropriate for sponsorship. Start with your less-tangible but extremely valuable assets such as:  ¡þ Right-of-way¡þThis is your greatest asset; sponsors don¡¯t have access to this exclusive asset ¡þ Your audience (measured by AADT count) ¡þYou can offer your sponsors an established, captive audience they have few other ways to address ¡þ Good will¡þBy establishing and operating your 511 services, you¡¯ve created an intimate, trusted relationship with travelers who rely on you for information Analysis	of	ITS	and	other	Assets	and	Their	Commercial	Value	You or a vendor needs to audit products such as:   ¡þ 511 system ¡þ DMS signs   ¡þ 511 Web site  ¡þ Interstate logos programs  ¡þ Existing infrastructure  ¡þ Service/Safety Patrol  ¡þ CCTV cameras    Examine transit assets such as the following for revenue possibilities:  ¡þ Vehicles (bus & rail) ¡þ Stations ¡þ Stops ¡þ Fare Cards  	  Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved. 	 Page	6	 Create	Sponsorship	Opportunities	Your next step is to determine what products to offer and at what rates. You may want to establish a broad array of individual products or offer bundles.   Here are some ideas:  ¡þ 511 Signs ¡þ 511 mobile app  ¡þ 511 Web site / personalized services ¡þ Interactive Voice Recognition ¡þ Sponsored CCTV camera images  ¡þ Sponsor and promote the 511 Web site    One thing to keep in mind is that sponsors will want to associate with an excellent, intuitive system with reliable data, so be sure your system fits the bill before considering revenue generation. Identify	Sponsors	 Suggested categories of acceptable sponsors include:  ¡þ Auto insurance ¡þ Cellular service providers ¡þ Service stations ¡þ Auto manufacturers and/or dealerships ¡þ Auto parts and care centers ¡þ Food and non-alcoholic beverages ¡þ Retail  ¡þ Tourism ¡þ Hospitality ¡þ Financial Products  Not all sponsors will be a good fit for your revenue generation program. Categories of non-acceptable sponsors to prohibit may include:  ¡þ Tobacco products  ¡þ Alcohol products (beer, wine, liquor)  ¡þ Words or images of weapons ¡þ Illegal drug use or drug paraphernalia ¡þ Any images of illegal materials  ¡þ Political advertisements  ¡þ Religious advertisements  ¡þ Advocacy advertisements  ¡þ Adult-oriented advertisements    In addition to carefully vetting sponsors, you need to establish an understanding with sponsors about which types of advertising are acceptable on your assets. Consider creating policies to prohibit advertisements that:  ¡þ Contain words or images that are obscene, vulgar or otherwise inappropriate for viewing by audiences of all ages  ¡þ Are offensive, false, misleading, deceptive or otherwise unacceptable  ¡þ Claim to repair bad credit or similar programs  ¡þ Promote unregulated gaming    Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved. 	 Page	7	 ¡þ Are known or determined to discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, disability, family status or marital status  ¡þ Do not comply with federal, state or local regulations  Implement	Your	Sales	Process	Once you¡¯ve got your sponsorship offerings and packages put together and priced, it¡¯s time to put your sales process together. You¡¯ll need to create a team to develop and manage:  ¡þ Pricing, Policies and Procedures ¡þMaximize revenue by establishing rates based on DEC¡ªDaily Effective Circulation¡ªthe method used by the outdoor advertising industry based on the annual average daily traffic (AADT) count of a location taking into account the average number of persons 18 and over in each vehicle, the visible traffic flow and the hours of illumination of the display.   Develop a solid understanding of relevant regulations, municipal, county, state and federal. Understand what may need to change in order to enable you to accept revenue from sponsors. Establish goals for revenue generation and if you haven¡¯t already, create policies for the type of sponsors and messages you will accept. Create a sales plan, including identifying potential sponsors and designing different levels of revenue support if required.    ¡þ Strategic sales of sponsorship packages¡þWhich sponsors will you target and how will you approach each? Create presentations that stress the value your system can deliver for the sponsor. Be sure to also understand how your organization can benefit not only from monetary support but other value from a partnership with the sponsor. Determine if your staff has the training and resources for the effort, or if you should partner with a vendor to handle sales. This can be quite an important decision given that most governmental entities have scant experience in selling.  ¡þ The public relations component of the effort¡þSponsorship of transportation assets such as static and interactive signage within the right-of-way brings with it not only great public relations opportunities for sponsors, but great responsibilities for your agency. Understand that participating sponsors receive an implied endorsement from your agency and the state by their acceptance into this program. You may need to manage how the public perceives sponsorship. Ensure that your reputation is enhanced through the selection of appropriate sponsors and through creation of a public relations campaign related to the sponsorship program. Be sure to understand how your revenue program delivers value to travelers, and be sure to stress these points in your PR. Make sure sponsors understand how news releases and media events will be approved and managed.    Copyright	?	2011,	Global-5 Inc., All rights reserved.

It¡¯s a brave new world, a world where ITS and big ticket infrastructure building and retrofitting projects will increasingly compete for funding sources that are not likely to grow as fast as do the public¡¯s needs.   In the new normal, if you want ITS programs like 511, and the public continues to demand more of them, you need to find a dedicated revenue source to be able to support, maintain, and enhance them. ITS programs are increasingly key to effective traffic congestion management, delivering the information to travelers to help them be part of the solution to traffic congestion rather than the problem. Through revenue generation programs, your 511 program and your sponsors can partner to take credit for delivering real congestion benefit.  Getting your 511 revenue generation program off the ground involves a lot of moving parts, a lot of work, and may require types of efforts and resources that you are not used to dealing with. Be sure to consider if your agency can undertake all that we¡¯ve discussed in this paper or whether it makes more sense to contract some or all of the program¡¯s design and implementation to an outside entity.

ITS: Post Implementation Strategies for Success  Brigid McGoran Canil and Jatinder Hayer  Abstract   With increased deployment and s ystem complexities of ITS infrastructure, the owners and other agencies frequently come across issues that were not anticipated at the initial stages o f c ertain pr ojects. I t i s p artly due t o t he fact t hat a d epartment w ithin an  organization r esponsible for t he c apital projects i s al most always di fferent t han the operations and maintenance departments. The O & M groups may lack the expertise, not have enough opportunity to provide input, and/or not have the authority to influence decisions made at the capital projects office.  These systems can span across several different jurisdictions, each with their own set of priorities. In most cases the project costs are also shared among different agencies, which can complicate matters further when i t c omes t o t he q uestion o f i nfrastructure ownership and r esponsibility o f operations and maintenance.  The objective of this paper is to highlight some of the challenges faced by infrastructure owners in the operations and maintenance of these systems and recommend strategies to successfully operate ITS Infrastructure.   Introduction An Intelligent Transportation System typically consists of:  1. Field Devices  are pieces of hardware with embedded software that help gather field information or display information for the travellers. Webcameras, Dynamic Message S igns ( DMS) and R oadside W eather I nformation S ystems ar e examples of field devices.  2. Central C ontrol enables t he c ollection o f field dat a, pr ocessing o f t he d ata collected based on a pre-established set of rules to create useful information for travellers, and di sseminate t his i nformation by  m eans o f one or m ore user interfaces. T he central c ontrol t ypically c onsists of s ingle or  m ultiple c ontrol systems w ith l ocal s oftware ap plications and har dware s uch as  DMS c ontrol software, servers, routers, and modems.    3. Communication Li nks are required to ena ble t he i nterface b etween t he f ield devices and central control. Radio, cellular, hardwire or fibre optic communication links are quite common in ITS.  4. Public/User Interface is a means of communicating information to the traveller. It can be in the form a web page and perhaps an IVR or DMS.  An Intelligent Transportation System could be a standalone system or an agency may have several interconnected systems, Figure 1 shows a schematic of one such system. Once these s ystems have be en c ommissioned, several par ties may be c ollectively responsible for the maintenance and operation of different components of the system. For ex ample, t he ow ner ag ency m ay be r esponsible for op erating and m aintaining Central C ontrol, a c ellular s ervice pr ovider c ompany m ay be  r esponsible for t he Communication Link, an electrical maintenance contractor might be responsible for the maintenance o f F ield Devices and t he s oftware dev eloper m ay be r esponsible f or operating and maintaining the Public/User Interface. In addition, vendor supplied and maintained software packages are deployed to control field devices.   Figure 1 ¨C Key ITS Components  Key Issues Issues associated with the operation of ITS infrastructure can be broadly categorized into: Jurisdictional, Budgetary, and Technical. Jurisdictional Issues Jurisdictional issues typically arise when multiple agencies are involved.  The nature of ITS is such that it typically requires the deployment of field devices in large geographical areas, that can span across municipal, provincial or national boundaries. In areas such as Metro Vancouver, the best value for an ITS project can be realized by adopting a regional appr oach, w hich r equires i nvolvement o f multiple ag encies. D efining t he ownership of equipment and accountability for system performance is a challenge when multiple agencies are involved. Labour Union or other contractual agreements, local, federal or provincial laws may restrict the maintenance personnel from accessing field devices that are outside the boundaries of their area of operation. Budgetary Issues Compared t o t raditional t ransportation i nfrastructure, ow ner ag encies ar e r elatively inexperienced i n the oper ation o f ITS i nfrastructure. I TS dev ices r equire f requent replacement compared to other transportation infrastructure. Typically the lifespan of ITS devices are 7 to 10 years, whereas the lifespan of most transportation devices are much longer. Accurate forecasting of operating budgets requires availability of historic data and experience; lack of both may result in under-budgeting. As ITS projects are often early winners, many partners step up to the table to contribute to the capital costs, but few contribute to the operations and maintenance costs.  ITS projects soon become popular with the public and m ore is demanded of them as the public b ecome used to t he b enefits.  Without pr ovisions for e xpansion o f ex isting infrastructure, public agencies may find that the cost of expansion is higher than it would have been if expansion provisions were included while infrastructure was being built. Technical Issues An Intelligent Transportation System can be described as consisting of the following sub-systems: Transportation, I nformation Technology and C ommunication N etworks. Each one  of t hese ar eas requires a di fferent skill-set a nd technical ex pertise. A  combination of all these skills is required for successful implementation and operation of Intelligent Transportation S ystems. It i s di fficult t o e mploy i n-house per sonnel w ith expertise in all these areas by the owner agencies. Most agencies rely on a number of service providers or vendors for support in one or all of these areas. The challenge then is to coordinate Operations and Maintenance activities among all the service providers by the agency and achieve a high level of system reliability.  When the system¡¯s operation is disrupted ¨C the first question is what has failed? It could be the device in the field, the central control hardware or software, communications link or a c ombination o f any  of  t hese elements. To d etermine w hat has  failed, troubleshooting of one or more of the components in Figure 1 might be r equired. The next q uestion t hen i s - who i s r esponsible f or t roubleshooting a nd w here s hould i t begin? Once a proper diagnosis has been completed, remedial action can follow. Since there are several parties involved in the maintenance of ITS, each responsible for just part of the system, the required effort by either party in the troubleshooting process would vary depen ding on the steps followed. For example, say the first step in the troubleshooting process is for the electrical maintenance contractor to go into the field to check out the field device and they find out that problem lies elsewhere, their effort has been i n v ain. S imilar s cenarios ex ist f or all ot her s takeholders when i t c omes t o troubleshooting.   Example of a Multi-Jurisdictional Project There are a n umber of designated crossings along the Canada-USA border in close proximity in the Lower Mainland area of Vancouver, BC.  These border crossings have frequent line-ups depending on time of day as well as day of the week.  T o reduce congestion and d elay f or t he t ravelling pub lic, t he C ross-Border Advanced T raveller Information System (ATIS) was developed and deployed.   Figure 2 is a system illustration for the Southbound and Figure 3 for Northbound ¡®Cross-Border Advanced Traveller Information System (ATIS)¡¯ deployed for crossings at Hwy 99/I-5 and Hwy 15/SR-543.         Figure 2 ¨C Southbound Cross-Border Advanced Traveller Information System The C ross B order A TIS i nforms t ravellers w hat t he ex pected delays are at ea ch crossing. Travellers have the flexibility to access this information on a website, on the Dynamic M essage S igns as  t hey appr oach t he b order c rossings, or  by  l istening t o messages through an IVR.  The website also displays images from cameras located along a stretch of Highway close to the border crossing to help travellers see how long the traffic line ups are. This helps travellers decide which border crossing to use.  The system reduces delays overall and has been readily accepted by the public.  Key c omponents o f t he s ystem i nclude: c ameras, l oop detectors, adv anced field controllers, i nteractive v oice r ecorders ( IVR), w eb i nterface an d D ynamic M essage Signs.     Figure 3 ¨C Northbound Cross-Border Advanced Traveller Information System  The agencies i nvolved i n t his project include: Transport C anada, BC M inistry o f Transportation and Infrastructure, FHWA, WashDOT, Whatcom Council, CBSA and US CBP.  BC M inistry of T ransportation an d I nfrastructure l eads t he o peration a nd maintenance of the southbound ATIS. The Ministry has employed the services of an electrical maintenance contractor and one software maintenance provider.   Currently the BC Ministry of Transportation has separate contracts with the electrical maintenance contractor and the software maintenance provider.  Challenges Some of the Southbound ATIS loop detectors and cameras are located south of the international boundary. The loop detectors often get disconnected or damaged during construction ac tivities. Vehicle counts from these detectors are needed for accurate calculation o f del ay information. S ince t here i s no obl igation o n t he c onstruction contractor¡¯s part to provide temporary count data until final loops are installed at the end of construction, the Southbound ATIS system cannot provide any delay time information during periods of construction. It has been very difficult for the Ministry to negotiate installation of t emporary l oops t o provide dat a t o t heir s ystem, especially s ince t he construction contractor is not under contract with the Ministry but with US GSA.  It took considerable negotiation to come up with a solution that would satisfy all parties.   The Ministry has separate contracts with the Electrical Maintenance Contractor and the Software Service provider. Since there is no direct contractual relationship between the two service providers, the roles and responsibilities are not very clear. As described in the Technical Issues section, each party is responsible for just part of the system, the required effort by either party in the troubleshooting process would vary depending on the s teps f ollowed. I t i s di fficult t o as sign ac countability and c learly def ine r oles of service providers in such a scenario. Public agencies experience higher than anticipated operations and maintenance costs for field devices, central control, software maintenance and communication services.  This i s t rue for r eplacement o f the S outhbound ATIS system c omponents such as  Advanced Field Controllers (AFC).   As the AFCs reach the end of their lifespan and since there are no spare parts, the BC MoTI has had to obtain used AFCs from the Ministry of Transportation Ontario.   The Northbound Cross Border ATIS has been expanded to SR 539 and SR 9, and the BC MoTI is currently expanding the Southbound ATIS to include Hwy 13 and H wy 11.  Fortunately, t he or iginal S outhbound A TIS was des igned an d c onstructed for future expansion.  Recommendations: The f ollowing strategies ar e pr oposed t o minimize t he i mpact of i ssues di scussed above: Ownership: A single lead agency should be responsible for ownership and operation of the entire system.  In the case of cross-border or multi-jurisdictional projects, a clear demarcation o f ownership and  r esponsibility needs t o be defined.  S ervice Lev el Agreements should be es tablished between jurisdictions that detail clear expectations and deliverables.  Planning: Solicit input of local agencies to develop a l ong term Regional ITS Plan.  A clear understanding of ITS objectives and delegation of responsibilities across agencies is necessary to realize full value of the project. Implementation of long term service and warranty contracts with vendors of specialized equipment and software will go a l ong way to eliminate some of the budgetary issues as well as a modular design that is suited for future expansion of the system.   Protocol: Clear set of rules for troubleshooting and involvement of responsible service providers at each step must be included in service contracts to avoid finger pointing among service providers. The lead maintenance agency is best suited to be in charge of all corrective and preventive maintenance initiatives.  System Issues: Data management, storage and access need to be negotiated with all participating agencies, and one agency needs to take the lead.  Other systems issues are interfacing legacy software and h ardware packages, and ensuring that web page servers are robust enough to handle expanding public demand. Maintenance: A s ingle m aintenance c ontract s hould be  es tablished w ith t he other maintenance providers working as subs to the lead contractor.  T his will increase the efficiency of maintenance as well as accountability. Training: A dequate t raining of  personnel i s nec essary f or the success o f a ny I TS project. This includes training maintenance contractor personnel as well as educating public agency personnel responsible for managing those contracts.  Work with vendors and maintenance contractors to develop a training plan for maintenance personnel as well as implement ongoing training with contractors and the lead agency.  Communication: A robust communication plan must be implemented to inform the public about the launch of a new ITS project. T ravellers also need t o be informed of any scheduled or scheduled system outages in a timely manner.    Conclusion  ITS solutions are usually well received by the travelling public and travellers expect a certain l evel of  r eliability of  t hese systems. G rowing depl oyments and c omplexities require that post implementation needs be identified and taken into consideration at the planning stage. There will always be operational challenges that are unique to certain agencies or regions, however the strategies provided here are applicable in most cases.

 CONNECTED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY - DRIVING FOR CHANGE IN THE WAY TRANSPORTATION IS FUNDED AND DELIVERED  James C. Barbaresso Vice President and National ITS Practice Leader HNTB Corporation 719 Griswold Street, Suite 620 Detroit, Michigan 48226 1-313-961-3330, jbarbaresso@hntb.com     ABSTRACT  The United States is facing a transportation funding crisis brought about by economic instability, an unprecedented federal deficit, rising fuel prices, and the downward spiral in transportation user fee receipts. With little hope for a federal fuel tax increase on the horizon, the situation is exacerbated by the push toward vehicle electrification and delays in reauthorization. As a result, transportation agencies are experiencing funding uncertainty and dramatically scaled back programs. All of these trends point toward further under-investment in transportation in the future and the continuing degradation of the nation¡¯s transportation infrastructure unless immediate steps are taken to implement a stable, sustainable transportation funding solution.   Connected Vehicle technology may hold the key to overcoming these funding challenges.  -2-  CONNECTED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY - DRIVING FOR CHANGE IN THE WAY TRANSPORTATION IS FUNDED AND DELIVERED  THE PROBLEM There is a perfect storm brewing in surface transportation. The United States is facing a transportation funding crisis brought about by a weak economy, an unprecedented federal deficit, rising fuel prices, and the downward spiral in transportation user fee receipts. With little hope for a federal fuel tax increase on the horizon, the situation is exacerbated by the push toward vehicle electrification, delays in reauthorization, and the repeal of guaranteed federal transportation funding levels. As a result, transportation agencies are experiencing funding uncertainty and dramatically scaled back programs in 2011 and beyond.  All of these trends point toward further, future under-investment in transportation and the continuing degradation of our nation¡¯s transportation infrastructure unless immediate steps are taken to implement a solution for stable, sustainable transportation funding.  Solving our transportation funding problems will mean looking beyond the nozzle and our dependence on fuel taxes. The fuel tax is an outdated concept negatively impacted by inflation, increased fuel efficiency and changing driving habits. Diminishing fuel tax revenues are starving the Highway Trust Fund at a time when transportation infrastructure needs have never been greater. Add to this the uncertainty surrounding Highway Trust Fund authorization levels with the Congressional action taken on January 5, 2011. Fuel tax receipts will erode even further as electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent. Recently, auto executives and political leaders have been promoting progress in vehicle electrification. Nissan and General Motors have released production model EVs, and all other major automakers are planning such releases. Political leaders are jumping on the EV bandwagon, especially following the Gulf oil spill, expected higher fuel prices, growing emphasis on sustainability and a new push toward ¡°green collar¡± businesses and jobs.  These changes should be the impetus in the way we fund and deliver transportation projects and services, and Connected Vehicle Technology may hold the key to overcoming these challenges. CONNECTED VEHICLE SOLUTION During much of the 20th Century, transportation professionals looked ahead to a future where technology would reduce vehicle crash rates, improve traffic flow, and offer a stable solution for transportation funding. We are now at that point we envisioned last century. The technology is here to help solve many of our most critical transportation issues. Unfortunately, the technology is evolving faster than the institutional and political will to solve this growing problem.  -3-  Connected Vehicle deployment scenarios have focused on safety and mobility applications, but attempts to build a ¡°business case¡± based solely on safety and mobility benefits have failed. While Connected Vehicle safety and mobility benefits will be substantial, they cannot readily be converted to capital needed for deployment or operations. Under these scenarios, a sizeable investment by the public sector will be required.   Public sector financing of such a system through traditional means does not appear to be feasible. Fuel tax receipts have not kept up with transportation needs, and legislators appear to be reticent to increasing fuel taxes when fuel prices are at record highs. It seems like the traveling public has a sense of entitlement when it comes to transportation system benefits. Most people do not know how much they pay in transportation user fees. Fuel taxes are merely part of the overall tax pie that people pay and for which they expect a bevy of public services, including transportation. Consequently, the benefits realized through better transportation systems and services are difficult to commoditize and sell to a public that believes they have already paid for them.  A new paradigm for transportation funding is needed. The framework for this paradigm should include: ¡þ Continuation of the user fee principle. ¡þ Provision of stable, sustainable funding. ¡þ A nexus between transportation system usage and user fees paid. ¡þ Realization of greater societal benefits in terms of safety, mobility and the environment. Connected Vehicle Technology provides the basis for this new paradigm.  Yet, Connected Vehicle deployment scenarios have ignored the opportunity to leverage this technology to supplement or replace outmoded fuel taxes as a source of transportation funding. Not only does such a scenario offer benefits for sustainable transportation funding, but the ancillary benefits of safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability come with the package. Connected Vehicle Technology can be used to supplement or replace outmoded fuel taxes as a source of transportation funding through applications like vehicle miles-based pricing and tolling. With NHTSA¡¯s upcoming regulatory decision about vehicle-to-vehicle safety, the enabling technology for a transportation pricing solution will be in the car this decade.  The model for a national roll-out of Connected Vehicle Technology can be based on innovative financing and public-private partnerships that are used for large infrastructure deployment projects around the world. Business models such as this have been used successfully by toll authorities for decades and offer the opportunity for investment in transportation infrastructure. For example, state DOTs might use a design-build-finance model or obtain competitive proposals from concessionaires for Connected Vehicle Technology deployment. This is possible if transportation funding is adopted as a primary objective for Connected Vehicle Technology deployment. In essence, the infrastructure is financed by the private sector, who would build the infrastructure required for collection of the user fees. As revenues are collected by the system, the private sector recoups the initial investment with a reasonable rate-of-return.  -4-  This mechanism for collecting user fees has greater public support than any other transportation funding mechanism. A 2010 survey conducted by HNTB Corporation found that most Americans support tolls to generate transportation revenue. In fact, respondents favored tolling over fuel taxes by a factor of greater than 2-to-1.     When it comes to governance, a number of options are available. The states could use the contractor to not only finance the infrastructure, but also to maintain and operate it. This may require concession agreements with the contractor teams. On the other hand, the public sector may wish to maintain the infrastructure, just as they currently maintain traffic signals and ITS devices, especially with safety and mobility objectives in mind. Since the governing body is receiving revenues from the system, the pricing model must take into account the need for on-going maintenance and operation of the system. A third alternative may be to establish a separate authority in each state to maintain the infrastructure and process the revenues generated. This is similar to current toll authorities or congestion management agencies. Legislation would be required in many states to allow this procurement approach and the option for a separate authority to manage Connected Vehicle Technology. Regulatory oversight will be required for separate authorities or concessions similar to those required for current concessions and public utilities. The federal role would be that of facilitator under this scenario. Of course, a portion of the new user fee receipts could be apportioned to federal coffers, similar to current fuel tax receipts, for national initiatives and support of federal programs. This deployment scenario involves conflicting objectives between revenue generation and improvements to safety, mobility and the environment. The deployment scenario must include state DOT and local agency oversight to ensure that infrastructure is deployed in a manner that will optimize safety and mobility benefits, while also meeting user fee needs. A systems -5-  engineering approach should be utilized to establish a concept of operations, clear roles and responsibilities, and the procurement approach within each state. A business plan must be part of the proposals from concessionaires or contractors. Public concerns over distracted driving and privacy are casting roadblocks on Connected Vehicle Technology deployment. Additionally, policy statements by the current administration have limited a healthy debate regarding the implementation of Connected Vehicle based user fee approaches. The public concerns about distracted driving can be overcome with good human factors engineering. However, overcoming these policy-related roadblocks require political will. Given the current state of our transportation infrastructure, the United States may be running out of time to develop and execute such a plan.  CONCLUSION Connected Vehicle Technology offers a solution for solving our transportation funding crisis that is self-funded, self-sustaining, and based on user fee principles. Dramatic benefits in safety and mobility are possible. However, this requires that we step out of the box and look beyond the current funding scenarios for Connected Vehicle infrastructure deployment. The key is to consider Connected Vehicle Technology as the enabler for a new means of collecting transportation user fees, while also delivering safety, mobility and a cleaner environment.

C/VISs are designed to provide a low-cost countermeasure to crashes resulting from improper lane changes and backing maneuvers by increasing drivers¡¯ visibility of the area around their truck. Under the United States Department of Transportation¡¯s indirect visibility research program, the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) was contracted to investigate the utility of C/VISs and drivers¡¯ acceptance of them. At the onset of this program in 2003, C/VISs were -2-  already commercially available, yet little was known about their effectiveness. VTTI identified drivers¡¯ C/VIS needs and developed numerous C/VIS concepts. A series of usability tests and controlled experiments were then performed over three major research phases. The findings from each phase were used to iterate the C/VIS design and produce system requirements for a C/VIS that simplified the driving task and improved drivers¡¯ spatial awareness. This paper documents the human factors and systems engineering approach followed throughout the C/VIS research program, where C/VIS requirements were incrementally developed using an iterative and controlled process that involved collaboration between multiple disciplines and focused on the drivers¡¯ needs.  Key Words: Commercial Motor Vehicle, Camera/Video Imaging System, Crash Countermeasure, Driver Assistance System, Heavy Truck, Human Factors,  Indirect Visibility System, Systems Engineering, User-Centered Design  INTRODUCTION  The No-Zone refers to the blind spots that exist around Commercial Motor Vehicles (CMVs). The No-Zone surrounding a CMV comprises four large areas: 1) the front No-Zone which is a 10-20 foot area in front of the cab, 2) the rear No-Zone which is an area behind the trailer that extends up to 200 feet, and 3) the side No-Zones which are areas on the left and right of the CMV that extend back 20-40 feet (Figure 1). The No-Zone can compromise drivers¡¯ ability to safely change lanes (1, 2). An analysis of the 2009 National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System database found that crashes resulting from a CMV sideswiping an adjacent vehicle during an improper lane change, merge, or turning maneuver account for 6.3 percent of truck crashes (approximately 20,300 crashes)(3).    Figure 1. Illustration of the No-Zone, Adapted from AAA Public Affairs (1)  Camera/Video Imaging Systems (C/VISs) are designed to provide a low-cost countermeasure to crashes resulting from improper lane changes, turns, and backing maneuvers by displaying live video of the No-Zone to the driver using monitors mounted inside the truck cabin. In 2003, C/VISs were already commercially available, yet little was known about their effectiveness. -3-  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in conjunction with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, contracted the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to investigate the utility of C/VISs and assess drivers¡¯ acceptance of them. A component of this research was to identify the ideal enhancements a C/VIS should provide and to evaluate drivers¡¯ performance with them. A Human Factors and systems engineering approach was taken to develop a C/VIS for these tests. What this process entailed is explained below.   A system is a series of components that work together to accomplish a common objective (4). Systems engineering refers to the proactive, incremental design and integration of system components to ensure that they work together, rather than constructing each component separately and trying to fit them together later (4, 5). Systems whose components are designed independently all too often result in suboptimal performance. This is particularly true when the technological components are designed without consideration for the human operator, forcing the human to adapt when operating the system. Human Factors engineering is the application of information pertaining to human capabilities and limitations to the design of systems for safe, comfortable and effective human use (4). Human Factors engineers contribute to the design of systems by ensuring an optimal fit between the operators and the technological components (4). A ¡®¡®fit¡¯¡¯ between users and the system is achieved when ¡°the system components are designed such that the people in the system can perform with a low probability of error, injury, illness, or stress and a high probability of productivity, quality, safety, and job satisfaction¡± (5). An optimal fit can be realized by identifying the operators¡¯ needs early on in the system development cycle, and to evaluating whether the system meets these needs as the system components are developed through an iterative and controlled process.  This paper describes how CMV driver needs for a C/VIS were identified at the onset of the indirect visibility research program. It then recounts how an iterative and controlled process involving Human Factors engineering was undertaken to develop a C/VIS that meets these needs. This paper recounts the methods used to assess driver performance and acceptance of the C/VIS throughout the development cycle.   CONCEPT EXPLORATION  The design of the C/VIS began with Wierwille, Schaudt, Spaulding, et al. (6) performing a review of the relevant literature on indirect visibility systems, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards, mirror regulations, recommended practices, and similar systems and patents. The acquired information, in addition to expert judgment from veteran Human -4-  Factors engineers, was used to perform a concept exploration. Eleven C/VIS concepts were devised in this effort to improve drivers¡¯ view of their surroundings. The concepts explored various vantage points for exterior cameras, the number of cameras needed, camera lens field-of-views (FOVs), and monitor locations.   IDENTIFYING CMV DRIVER REQUIREMENTS  A focus group was then held with 10 CMV drivers to acquire their opinions of the C/VIS concepts and to allow them to suggest additional C/VIS concepts. An experimenter first gave a 20 minute presentation on C/VISs and how they can enhance the view of the No-Zone. Participants then reported the perceived blind spots and suggested potential C/VIS concepts that could improve their visibility of the No-Zone. Four new concepts were identified in addition to the eleven concepts generated during the concept exploration effort. These 15 concepts were then presented to participants one at a time. Participants rated each concept¡¯s receptiveness, adaptability, safety benefit, and usefulness. Participants also ranked the 15 concepts from most to least desirable. Using the feedback from the focus group, similar concepts were combined to produce the list of 13 concepts.  DEVELOPMENT OF C/VIS PROTOTYPES  Because the majority of the 13 concepts had never been tested, preliminary usability tests were performed on a controlled test-track. Eleven of the 13 C/VIS concepts could represent the entire set and were developed into working prototypes. This involved substantial Human Factors input and collaboration with mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. This multi-disciplinary team worked together to select and acquire the appropriate video equipment and hardware materials. Hardware bracketing was fabricated. Power conditioning and wire interconnections were completed. The prototypes were then tested with the objective of obtaining sufficient information to generalize the results across the entire set of concepts. The results are described next.   Usability Tests with Prototypes Four VTTI employees who had a Commercial Driver¡¯s License (CDL) participated. Drivers performed multiple tasks including highway tasks, parking tasks, backing tasks, and low-speed maneuvers on the Virginia Smart Road, which is a 2.2 mile test track facility located at VTTI in Blacksburg. All tasks were performed during daytime conditions. These tests resulted in an abundance of information. Drivers indicated that they preferred color displays compared to monochrome displays (when there was daylight outside). With regard to display location, drivers liked the monitors at the A-pillars and center dash. Drivers did not -5-  like the monitors placed in the front header because they required large upward head movements to see them. Secondly, drivers¡¯ peripheral vision could not be used. Drivers were accepting of the monitors being placed in the side headers near the top of the A-pillars. Some of the monitors¡¯ display brightness fluctuated due to the cameras¡¯ auto-iris control. This informed the designers that smoothing should be used to prevent rapid fluctuations in the display brightness. According to the drivers, a FOV of 45 to 55 degrees produced the most natural appearing image with little or no image distortion. It was also found that sunlight tended to produce glare on the monitors, indicating that glare shields may need to be implemented in the final concept designs.   Controlled Experimentation (Formal Road Tests) The usability tests produced adequate information to develop design specifications for some of the C/VIS prototypes. However, because some of the C/VIS concepts were similar, controlled experimentation was needed to determine which C/VIS prototype led to better driver performance and was more liked by drivers. Six C/VIS concepts (nine, counting pairs) were thus selected for formal road testing. Twenty four CDL qualified drivers who were na?ve to the systems and road tests were recruited. Four of the C/VIS concepts were designed to be used in combination with mirrors (enhancement system), while the remaining two concepts were designed to be used as an alternative to mirrors (surrogate system). The six C/VISs tested are listed in Table 2.  Table 2. Concepts Selected for Controlled Experimentation. Taken from Wierwille, Schaudt, Spaulding, et al.

Example of In-Cab Monitor and the Trailer Rear Wide-Angle Multipurpose Look-Down C/VIS, Taken from Wierwille, Schaudt, Spaulding, et al. (6)  Tests included typical highway driving tasks (light vehicle clearance/overlap determination, passing and merging maneuvers), as well as three backing tasks (parked vehicle, loading dock, and S-curve) using a Peterbilt tractor/trailer and a Volvo tractor (6). Each driver performed driving tasks with a specific set of C/VISs and provided opinion data. Drivers¡¯ performance with and without a C/VIS was compared. The formal road tests showed that the C/VIS enhancements could improve drivers¡¯ performance (6, 7). Although, the C/VISs were not found to help drivers execute S-curve backing maneuvers. The results provided insight on driver performance and acceptance of the concepts. Specifications were written for the C/VISs based on the information acquired from the focus group, driver preferences, preliminary test results, and formal test results (8).  EXPANDING THE C/VIS OPERATIONAL WINDOW  The next step of the research program was to expand the C/VISs¡¯ operational window. An Enhanced C/VIS, termed the E-C/VIS, was designed to provide simultaneous coverage of the sides and rear of a heavy vehicle with an operating envelope that included daytime and nighttime conditions, as well as clear and inclement weather conditions. It was designed to improve drivers¡¯ situational awareness, with a specific objective of reducing sideswipe crashes when heavy vehicles merge or change lanes. It should be noted that the E-C/VIS was intended to supplement the current side mirrors¡ªnot replace them. The E-C/VIS design was also limited to use technology that could be developed at a reasonable cost in order to be adopted by commercial carriers. The methods used to develop the E-C/VIS, as well as the results obtained from its evaluation, are described below. Details pertaining to these methods and results can be found in Wierwille et al. (9).   -7-  Selection of E-C/VIS Components Camera Selection The first step was to identify a high resolution and sensitive camera that was capable of automatically adjusting its gain and switching between color and monochrome modes in low light. Numerous cameras were reviewed and a few were purchased for testing. The selected cameras were tested in a darkened laboratory. Numerous visible and infrared (IR) illumination sources and filters were examined, with the objective of developing a video chain that was responsive to a wide range of lighting. The tests included capturing video of a vehicle or target, so that images could be compared. The selected "first place" camera was the Toshiba IK-64DNA camera (Figure 3a). It had daytime color capability and nighttime monochrome capability, and it was sensitive at night (0.003 lux) to both visible and infrared (IR) illumination.   Figure 3. a) Toshiba IK-64DNA Camera used in the E-C/VIS Stud. b) Toshiba IK-64DNA Camera Housing used in the E-C/VIS Study  Illumination Sources Because the C/VIS was to operate at night, the use of light from sources around the truck was investigated as a way of illuminating surrounding objects. Both sources that produced visible light and IR light were considered.   Camera Housing A waterproof housing was fabricated by VTTI mechanical engineers for the Toshiba IK-64DNA camera (Figure 3b). The housing was fastened to the right fender of the test truck. The camera housing was mounted on a weighted platform to reduce the amount of vibration it experienced from the truck.   -8-  Image Processing VTTI computer engineers in conjunction with Human Factors engineers developed an image processing function that identified edges in the video image and traced white lines around these edges. This image processing served to highlight objects detected in the video and make them easier for drivers to detect. It was believed that image processing would assist drivers in detecting the presence of adjacent vehicles when making cursory glances to the monitors.   E-C/VIS Monitor The image processing developed for the E-C/VIS required the use of a monitor with vector graphics array (VGA) input so that delays in presenting the video image would be minimal. A VGA monitor was therefore placed on the passenger-side A-pillar of the test truck cab.  Static Tests of E-C/VIS Components To perform the outdoor stationary tests, a major outdoor "simulator" was developed which included a tractor-trailer equipped with multiple units of the visible and IR illuminators. A weather system was developed to produce wind up to 73 mph using an airboat propeller and rain using nozzles mounted on towers. This system allowed testing of highway rain conditions while the test vehicles were stationary. Tests involved VTTI employees rating the C/VIS monitor image while manipulating various parameters of the camera and environment. A variety of target vehicle positions were used during these tests. Because the efficacy of using visible light to illuminate the areas around the truck was being tested, the participants also rated the discomfort glare of viewing these illuminators from within the adjacent vehicle. Results demonstrated that all ratings of the E-C/VIS prototype were satisfactory or better. Glare from the visible illumination was found to be well within an acceptable level. However, results showed that the IR illuminators had slightly better ratings and, of course, produced no glare. Therefore, the use of IR illuminators around the truck was selected. The image processing seemed to work well. A few problem areas were uncovered, and solutions were suggested for them.  Development of the E-C/VIS Working Prototype Results of the outdoor stationary tests were used to finalize the E-C/VIS. Cameras contained in the weather-proof housings were mounted on the right and left fenders of the test vehicle (Figure 4a). These fender-mounted cameras followed the convex mirror enhancement specifications set forth in the previous C/VIS research phase. Each camera had a 45-degree FOV to minimize image distortion and produce an image that was comparable to the existing fender mirrors. Although the right side wide-angle blind-spot enhancement was a prime -9-  candidate for the right fender camera due to its 88 degree FOV, results from testing the 45-degree FOV convex mirror enhancement indicated that it could possibly cover the right No-Zone ordinarily viewed by drivers using a right side fender mirror, the look-down mirror, and the window located on the right door near the foot well. In addition to the two fender cameras, a third wide-angle multipurpose look-down camera was mounted at the top rear of the trailer. This camera had a 102-degree FOV. VGA monitors positioned on the left and right A-pillars displayed the video captured from the left and right fender cameras, respectively (Figure 4b). A monitor mounted at the top center of the windshield displayed the video captured by the rear camera. The E-C/VIS provided drivers with night vision capabilities using eight infrared illuminators around the tractor-trailer. The E-C/VIS also allowed drivers to select the amount of image processing to use.    a) b) Figure 4. a) Coverage Provided by E-C/VIS Cameras Shown by Grey Shading. No-Zone Shown by the Diagonal Line. b) Placement of E-C/VIS Monitors in Truck Cabin, Taken from Wierwille et al. (9)  Static Testing with E-C/VIS Prototype Static testing was performed using eight CMV drivers to evaluate their object detection and identification performance with the E-C/VIS, and to allow them to become familiar with the system prior to performing the dynamic tests (10). The static tests were performed in a large blacktopped area at VTTI using a variation of the paradigm developed by Jenness, Llaneras, and Huey (11). Participants were instructed to detect an object that had been placed around the tractor-trailer, and identify what it was. Participants performed this task with the conventional mirror system only, and while using both the mirrors and the E-C/VIS. Four different objects were used in this task: an orange construction barrier, a pedestrian, a yellow adult tricycle, and a stop sign placed on a pole. Participants were found to locate objects faster and more accurately with the E-C/VIS compared to when only using the mirror system.   -10-  Dynamic Tests Dynamic tests were then performed on the E-C/VIS at night and in inclement weather using the Virginia Smart Road test facility. Here, both baseline (mirrors only) and E-C/VIS (mirrors plus enhanced video) conditions were examined under nighttime and artificial lighting conditions. Both rainy and clear conditions were also examined. Rain was generated using more than 70 rain-producing towers along the Smart Road. The eight CMV drivers drove a heavy vehicle and determined the position of an adjacent vehicle. Drivers indicated whether there was longitudinal clearance or longitudinal overlap in feet, and how much overlap there was in terms of distance. It was found that drivers took advantage of the E-C/VIS when locating the adjacent vehicle, which resulted in less absolute error in estimating distance. Overall, the results show that the extended range of the E-C/VIS is quite useful and should reduce sideswipe crashes, increase the situation awareness of heavy-vehicle drivers, and also meet with their acceptance. Minor problems remained with the developed system; mainly that the VGA monitors could not be adequately dimmed and that the light reflected from them created a cross-reflection on the side windows that interfered with the drivers¡¯ view of the west coast mirrors. These problems were solved, however, in the development of the advanced C/VIS (called the A-C/VIS) that was used for a technology field demonstration (TFD).  DEVELOPMENT OF THE ADVANCED C/VIS  The third and most recent phase of the C/VIS research program involved field testing drivers¡¯ performance with a C/VIS while they drove in a real-world trucking operation. To perform this study, the E-C/VIS prototype had to be upgraded to a roadworthy system capable of withstanding the wear and tear brought on by the truck¡¯s vibration. An Advanced C/VIS, termed A-C/VIS, was developed. The A-C/VIS¡¯s design met the established daytime performance specifications set forth by Wierwille, Schaudt, Gupta, et al. (8), and adopted the features that made the E-C/VIS suitable for nighttime and inclement weather use. The efforts put forward to develop the A-C/VIS are presented below.   A-C/VIS Cameras The Toshiba IK-64DNA camera used by the E-C/VIS produced excellent images during the day and at night owing to its high sensitivity and retractable IR lens. However, this camera was not appropriate for the TFD because of its size and because its moving retractable IR lens could be damaged when exposed to excessive vibration. A Dallmeier MDF3000a camera was selected through a trade study that considered on-road data collected from four candidate cameras (Figure 5a). It was a compact and lightweight Complementary Metal¨COxide¨CSemiconductor (CMOS) camera (Figure 5b). Its size made it ideal for mounting -11-  to the truck¡¯s fenders without extending beyond the allowable vehicle width. The camera generated a crisp 540 TV line image and offered controllable color and monochrome modes. Other features that made the camera suitable for a C/VIS include auto-gain control, backlight compensation, and Progressive Scan image capture. It is worth noting here that this camera did not fail at any point during the year-long data collection effort.     a)  b) c) Figure 5. a) Candidate Cameras Mounted on Fender of Test Truck. b) Dallmeier MDF3000a Camera (Source: Dallmeier-Electronic.com (12). c) A-C/VIS Camera Housing Design  Camera Settings The Dallmeier MDF3000a was programmed to be in color mode during the daytime and in monochrome mode during the nighttime. At dusk, the day mode automatically switched to night mode once the ambient light dropped below 2 Lux. At dawn, the night mode automatically switched to day mode once the ambient light surpassed 10 Lux. These values were set by running road tests during dusk and dawn. If the driver disagreed with the automatic mode change, they could override the switchover and select which day/night mode to use.   Camera Housing The TFD required the A-C/VIS to function in various weather conditions. A weatherproof casing for the Dallmeier MDF3000a was designed and developed by VTTI (Figure 5c). The housing¡¯s shape was designed to prevent water from collecting over the camera lens while the vehicle was in operation. The housing was prototyped using a computer numerical controller mill at VTTI. This allowed the general shape to be positioned on the truck¡¯s fenders and adjusted prior to manufacturing the actual housings out of aluminum. The final aluminum housings were also manufactured at VTTI.   Camera Location Similar to the E-C/VIS, the A-C/VIS used three cameras (i.e., left-fender camera, right-fender -12-  camera, and rear-trailer camera) to provide drivers with a view of the area surrounding the tractor-trailer (Figure 6). Each camera was mounted such that the tractor-trailer could be seen along the edges of the video images in the monitors (Figure 6). Each camera¡¯s position, aim, and FOV was set to match those specified by the E-C/VIS¡¯s design.           Figure 6. The Three A-C/VIS Cameras and the Three A-C/VIS Monitors  A-C/VIS Monitors The monitors used by the A-C/VIS were selected to meet the specifications set forth in Wierwille, Schaudt, Gupta, et al. (8). AcceleVision LCD5A and LCD64A monitors were selected because of their sharp image, large viewing angles, and ability to be significantly dimmed at night. They were tested during the day inside the truck cabin and were found to provide a clear and bright image. They were also tested in an unlit room, as well as in the truck cabin at night, and when dimmed, were not found to provide discomfort glare. This characteristic was an important component that affected drivers¡¯ acceptance of C/VISs. Both monitors had an extended control board that allowed them to be easily integrated into the monitor housing (13).   Monitor Location The A-C/VIS used three monitors, each displaying an image from one of the three cameras mounted on the tractor-trailer. One monitor was mounted at the top of the left A-pillar and displayed the video image captured by the camera mounted on the left fender (Figure 7). The second monitor was mounted at the top-center of the windshield and displayed the video image captured by the rear wide-angle look-down camera mounted on the trailer. The final monitor was mounted at the top of the right A-pillar and displayed the video image captured by the camera mounted on the right fender.  -13-    Figure 7. Placement of A-C/VIS Monitors  The placement of the monitors was selected by balancing a multitude of criteria. First, nighttime C/VIS testing revealed that the light emitted from the monitors generated a cross reflection on the side windows. When the monitors were mounted at the bottom of the A-pillars (similar to the E-C/VIS layout), the cross reflection blocked the driver¡¯s view of the west coast mirrors. Attempts were made to eliminate this cross reflection by rotating the monitors such that the light they emitted was parallel to the side windows, and using privacy screens that only allowed light to travel within a 20-degree angle from the monitor. However, the rotated monitors were difficult to view, and the privacy screen reflected substantial light during the day. It was determined that cross reflection could not be eliminated, but that it could be controlled. By mounting the monitors at the top of the A-pillars, the reflected light was found to not interfere with the driver¡¯s view of the west coast mirrors. This location was also found to reduce the amount of sunlight reflected off the monitors during the day because the eyebrow of the truck casted a shadow across the monitors. Furthermore, the low eyebrow also meant that large upward head movements were not required to see the monitors. The height of the monitors was expected to encourage drivers to view them as they scanned from the forward roadway to their west coast and convex mirrors.   Because the truck used in the TFD had thinner A-pillars than the truck used in the previous research phases, user testing was performed to re-evaluate where the monitors should be positioned. Plastic cut-outs that were similar in size to the monitors were h eld at various locations around the windshield. Drivers were shown the locations and provided feedback on their position. It was determined that the left and right monitors should be mounted at the top of the A-pillars to not block the driver¡¯s view of t he road. Unfo rtunately, the design of the TFD test vehicle cabin interior did n ot allow the left monitor to be mounted in front of the A-pillar without substantial damage. As such, the left monitor was positioned to the right of the left A-pillar. The area covered by the monitor was no greater than the area covered by the -14-  sun visor when it was pulled down.   Because the monitors were mounted at the top of the A-pillars, discomfort glare produced by the light they emitted was a potential issue during nighttime driving. The A-C/VIS monitors¡¯ brightness could be reduced to 1.5 lux, which eliminated this issue.   Monitor Housing The A-C/VIS monitors were housed in a plastic casing that was d esigned to be rugged and sustain wear and tear encountered in the truck cabin. Figure 8 presents an image of the left monitor housing and the center monitor housing.    Figure 8. A-C/VIS Left and Center Monitor Housing  A-C/VIS Driver-Vehicle Interface (DVI) The left monitor housing contained the DVI controls (Figure 9a). The DVI was designed to give drivers quick and easy access to the functionality offered by the A-C/VIS. Special care was taken to avoid the use of on-screen menus to minimize the time drivers took their eyes off the road (14). The DVI was designed to allow all functionality to be directly accessed through six buttons. Usability testing using naive VTTI personnel was performed to optimize the DVI layout. Numerous concepts were evaluated using paper-and-pencil prototypes and scoring participants ability to complete preset tasks. The DVI allowed drivers to directly select the A-C/VIS features and it was not found to confuse the participants. The DVI allowed drivers to toggle between the day and night modes. The day mode presented drivers with a color image, while the night mode presented a monochrome image accompanied by IR illumination. Drivers could also toggle the ¡°object detection¡± feature, which was the name used instead of ¡°image processing¡± to be more intuitive to CMV drivers. This feature was activated by pressing the larger button on the right-most side of the display (Figure 9b).  -15-  a) b ) c) Figure 9. a) View of DVI on Left Monitor Housing. b) Example Image of A-C/VIS Object Detection Feature. c) IR Illuminators Mounted Underneath Trailer  IR Illuminators The E-C/VIS¡¯s design specified the location for the eight IR illuminators on a tractor equipped with a 53-ft trailer. However, because the trailers used in the TFD were 48-ft long, work was performed to ensure that the IR illuminators did not produce shadows from the IR light casted on the trailer¡¯s tires. An IR illuminator was mounted on both the left and right step of the truck cab, while three illuminators were mounted on both the left and right side of the trailer (Figure 9c). These illuminators were equally spaced along the side of the trailer. Tests were also performed to determine whether rotating the illuminators 90 degrees improved image clarity, but no differences were found.   Because the Dallmeier MDF3000a camera was not sensitive to IR light, it¡¯s standard lens was replaced with a 900 nm long-pass filter (Ch eshire Optical 900 IFLP  fi lter). This filter  attenuated light between 720 and 850 n m, a llowing the cam era to ca pture IR light and produce images of unlit objects at night.  A-C/VIS Turn Signal and Side Marker Light Diffusers Early testing with the A-C/VIS revealed that the optional side marker lights/turn signal lights mounted on the side of the truck could create a large bright spot on the monitors. To reduce discomfort glare and noise from this constant blooming, translucent plastic guards were placed in front of the turn signal lights (Figure 10). These plastic guards lowered the amount of light directly shined into the fender-mounted cameras, reducing the size of the bright spot on the monitor. It should be noted that the side turn signal lights are used to alert adjacent vehicle drivers of the truck¡¯s intent to change lanes, and that the turn signal light diffusers did not prevent the turn signal lights from being seen by adjacent vehicles.  -16-   Figure 10. A-C/VIS Light Diffuser Mounted in Front of Right Turn Signal  DRIVER OPINIONS OF A-C/VIS  Once the A-C/VIS was developed, drivers¡¯ performance with it was investigated. First, static testing was performed similar to that conducted with the E-C/VIS prototype. Participants were found to detect and identify objects using the A-C/VIS at the same performance level that previous participants performed using the E-C/VIS (15). The A-C/VIS was then tested through a TFD (16). Here, drivers were not found to encounter more safety-related events, or alter the distance to which they cut in front of an adjacent vehicle when changing lanes, when driving with the C/VIS. It should be noted that the majority of the driving observed in the TFD was performed at night when there are fewer vehicles on the road. The results do show, however, that drivers did not abuse the enhanced views provided by the C/VIS, nor were they distracted by the monitors. Feedback from drivers was found to be very informative for the development of future C/VISs. First, drivers indicated that the A-C/VIS made it easier to merge into traffic and identify objects located around their truck. They indicated that it made it easier to determine the approach rate of adjacent vehicles, and that it helped eliminate blind spots around their truck. Drivers ranked the A-C/VIS¡¯s center monitor as more useful than the right or left monitors (although the ranking of the right monitor was a close second). Drivers liked the A-C/VIS turn signal diffusers as they substantially reduced the blooming produced on the monitors when the turn signals were activated. All interviewed drivers indicated that they missed having a C/VIS on their truck one month after their participation in the study ended. These opinions suggest that the A-C/VIS may reduce driver workload and possibly reduce the stress associated with difficult lateral maneuvers.   SUMMARY  This paper described how a Human Factors and systems engineering approach was taken to develop a low-cost C/VIS that simplifies the driving task and increases drivers¡¯ spatial awareness. Drivers¡¯ needs were identified early on in the design cycle and driver performance and opinions of the C/VIS prototypes were used to inform the C/VIS design. The current C/VIS was found to assist drivers operating in a real-world trucking operation by making it -17-  easier to merge and detect objects around their truck. Drivers also indicated that the monitor brightness at night was not discomforting and did not produce unwanted reflections on the windows. The results show how a systems approach can identify usability issues early on in the prototyping stage and lead to a final product that is well received by end users.   Future Research Field tests should be performed to investigate the potential safety benefits offered by C/VIS when operating a commercial truck in high traffic density, harsher weather conditions, and reduced visibility conditions. Furthermore, the ability of future camera technology to address blooming from trailing vehicle head lights should be tested. Designing C/VIS such that they can be easily maintained should also be revisited in subsequent design iterations. For instance, cleaning the camera lens of the rear trailer camera may require the use of a device, or a ladder to allow the driver to clean, or access, the camera. The use of augmented reality to assist drivers in detecting adjacent vehicles and assessing their approach rate is also worthwhile given that drivers already use artifacts such as trailer shadows and trailer marker lights to help them gauge the clearance to adjacent vehicles. Finally, observation from heavy vehicle naturalistic driving studies have shown that there are drivers that fail to use their mirror system when changing lanes. As such, a C/VIS specifically designed to make vehicles travelling in the front-right area beside the cab more conspicuous should be investigated. This is particularly true because light vehicles are becoming smaller in size and easier to go undetected by CMV drivers.

The main goal was to assess whether individuals understood what systems were present or operational in a vehicle and whether prior exposure to that vehicle¡¯s owner¡¯s manual (or another vehicle¡¯s owner¡¯s manual) affected that knowledge. The four key systems investigated were forward collision warning (FCW), lane departure warning (LDW), blind spot warning (BSW), and adaptive cruise control (ACC). Participants were presented with high-resolution images of a vehicle¡¯s interior, and then asked about system presence or operational status. Overall, individuals were not accurate in assessing whether an advanced crash warning system was present (more than 40% of these responses were incorrect), but participants were nonetheless confident in their response accuracy. Familiarity with the vehicle¡¯s owner¡¯s manual improved comprehension slightly.  ACWS design issues are discussed.  Keywords:  ACWS, DVI, driver-vehicle interface, crash warning, CWIM, human factors -2-  INTRODUCTION  The Crash Warning Interface Metrics (CWIM) project addressed issues of the driver-vehicle interface (DVI) for Advanced Crash Warning Systems (ACWS) (1, 2). ACWS have the potential to improve driver performance and reduce the frequency and severity of common crash situations. ACWS are systems that use sensors to assess potential or emerging hazard situations and provide crash warning information to the driver. In some cases the system may also initiate some vehicle control action. Examples of ACWS include forward collision warning (FCW) systems and lane departure warning (LDW). ACWS are increasingly common in passenger vehicles and the characteristics of these systems vary considerably among vehicle manufacturers (3, 5). The experiment described in this paper is one of a series of experiments conducted to improve understanding of ACWS comprehension, effects of different warning modes, and research methods to investigate the effects of ACWS. The final report can be found in (1) and the final report for the broader CWIM project, which includes descriptions of all experiments performed in this line of research, can be found in (2).  Undoubtedly the success of any system will depend substantially on the quality of the DVI (3). The DVI refers to the displays and controls through which the driver and the system interact. Display attributes include the warning mode (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic), warning display content, signal conspicuity, display location, timing, reliability, active intervention in vehicle control aspects, and relation to (and integration with) other systems and displays. System controls may allow the driver to activate or deactivate the system or select certain operating characteristics. The DVI also includes information about the status of warning systems, so that the driver comprehends what safety functions are present in the vehicle and what their current operational status is. The DVI design issues are complex and various products providing similar functions may perform quite differently. If ACWS are to fulfill their potential for improving safety, it is essential to have an effective DVI.  The current study explores whether na?ve and informed drivers understand DVI functioning and operational status provided visually, with the goal of developing insights into possible DVI design improvements.   METHOD  Design  Participants in this experiment viewed high-resolution images of a vehicle interior and answered questions regarding the presence or status of various vehicle safety systems, utilizing a type of cognitive walkthrough method (4). Data were collected regarding the following variables: ? Comprehension was defined as response to a question about system presence/ status. ? Confidence was a participant¡¯s subjective rating of their confidence (on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 equals no confidence and 10 equals complete confidence) that their response to a question about system presence or status was correct. ? Decision time was the amount of time (in seconds) taken by a participant to answer a question about system presence or status). -3-  ? Location was the position within the image of the vehicle interior that a participant indicated that he or she sought the information that was used to determine whether a particular system was present or to determine its status.  The experiment was a fully crossed three-factor experimental design, with the following factors: ? Vehicle (between-subjects: 3 levels): Each participant viewed the interior of one of three vehicles: 2010 Infiniti FX 35, 2010 Buick Lucerne, or 2010 Volvo S80. These particular vehicles were selected in part because they used very different display strategies from each other (e.g., icons, text, acronyms). Also, certain packages of these vehicles ranged in the number of safety systems of interest, with one vehicle having the fewest (two systems) and another vehicle having the most (four systems).  ? Vehicle owner¡¯s manual familiarity (between-subjects: 3 levels): Prior to the experimental session, participants read sections of the owner¡¯s manual or related manufacturer-provided material for one of the three vehicles, or did not read any manual. This resulted in cases where the participant had familiarization (through the manual) with the vehicle they subsequently viewed, cases where the participant had familiarization with a different vehicle than the one they saw in the experiment, and cases where the participant had no familiarization with any of the vehicles. ? Scenario (within-subjects 3 levels): During the experimental session, data were collected in three phases, for which the views of the vehicle interior represented three situations: prior to starting the vehicle, after starting (but before driving), and during driving.   It is important to note that this experiment did not address driver response to imminent crash alerts, but rather the context in which these alerts occur. The driver¡¯s understanding of the warning and assistance provided by the vehicle may influence the response to crash warnings as well as other aspects of driving style. Misperceptions may lead to inappropriate driving strategies and slow or confused responses to imminent crash events, but this aspect of the ACWS interface has not been the subject of much research. While the current research indicates where comprehension problems might exist, it does not directly assess the effects of these systems on driving behavior or safety outcomes.  Vehicles and Manuals  Model year 2010 passenger vehicles were reviewed in order to select three exemplars for use in this experiment. The three vehicles chosen ¨C 2010 Infiniti FX 35, 2010 Buick Lucerne, and 2010 Volvo S80 ¨C were selected because each included multiple ACWS, they had status display characteristics that were distinct from one another, and they represented a range of manufacturers. Figure 1 shows an example picture of each of the three vehicle interiors. The figure also illustrates the three general scenario types. In the top left panel, the vehicle has not yet been started and no indicator displays are activated. In the top right panel, the ignition has been turned on. In the bottom panel, the vehicle is moving at 60 mph.  -4-     Figure 1. Example interior vehicle photos: Volvo S80 before startup (top left), Infiniti FX 35 at startup (top right), Buick Lucerne en route (bottom)  The Buick Lucerne contained LDW and BSW.  Also, the control buttons, which turn features or systems on or off, generally used icons, and the status displays were in text or icons. The Infiniti FX 35 contained three systems of interest: LDW, FCW, and ACC. Also, the Infiniti utilized acronyms for most control buttons, and icons for status information. The Volvo S80 contained the most systems of interest, with four: LDW, FCW, ACC, and BSW. It also used icons for control buttons and a text display for status information.   Some participants in the experiment read vehicle owner¡¯s information provided by the manufacturer. This information either came from the owner¡¯s manual or from associated information such as ¡°quick start¡± guides. The intent was to provide some familiarity with a particular vehicle interface. However, the information did not necessarily provide the information later queried in the experiment. The information that participants were instructed to read prior to their experimental session provided a general review of vehicle features and operations. The length and content of the required reading sections differed between the different vehicle models. More detailed information in the full manual was available as an option if the participant wished to read it, but very few did. Participants were tested on their knowledge to ensure that they had read at least the quick start guide.  Participants  A total of 111 individuals participated in the experiment in May and June of 2010. Participants were approximately evenly divided between males and females, and their ages ranged from 25 to 60. All participants were recruited from the metropolitan Washington, DC area. Participants -5-  were required to have a current driver¡¯s license. To ensure that participants had limited familiarity with the features of interest in this experiment, individuals were only selected to participate if they did not currently or recently drive a vehicle of model year 2006 or later, and if they did not currently or recently drive a Buick, Infiniti, or Volvo vehicle of any model year.  Equipment and Photographs  Participants viewed high-resolution photographs of vehicle interior displays. Monitors allowed near-full size projection of the images and the screen resolution provided good legibility of text and symbols. The photography and image display were designed to replicate as closely as possible the view that drivers would actually experience when seated in the driver¡¯s seat of a given vehicle. The vehicle interior photos used for this experiment were 12 megapixels (4256 x 2832) in size. Many images were taken of each vehicle interior to capture various vehicle states and the presence or absence of various display features (e.g., buttons turned on or off, alert messages illuminated). Each final image used in the experiment was compiled using Adobe Photoshop from multiple original images in order to clearly show all features of interest. Symbols and messages that could not be photographed in the stationary vehicle (e.g., certain malfunction indicators) were recreated using image editing software. The full set of interior photos used in the experiment can be found in (1).  The computer displays used for this experiment had a 30-inch diagonal display area and a native resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Each monitor was calibrated to accurately reproduce the experiment images. Participants interacted with the experiment using styli and handheld touchpads with a 7-inch diagonal display and a resolution of 800 by 480 pixels. Participants used the touch pads to select answers to yes/no questions, to select ratings of confidence, and to indicate where in the interior of the vehicle they looked for particular features.  Procedure  Participants were shown various displays of the vehicle interior, with certain status displays activated in some scenarios. Participants indicated their understanding of the presence or status of various vehicle systems. In phrasing the questions, it was important to avoid descriptive terms that might bias participant¡¯s answers. Different manufacturers use different terminologies for systems with similar functions and the research team did not want to use terms that matched one terminology or display over another. Therefore the research team developed generic descriptive names to use in the questions for all three vehicles. For example, a LDW system was described as ¡°A stay in lane alert system warns the driver if the vehicle starts to drift out of its lane (for example, if the driver is drowsy or distracted).¡± Participants were given a glossary that defined each generic term that they could refer to during the experiment if they did not understand what a particular feature did.  Up to three individuals participated per session. All participants in a given session were in the same literature/vehicle condition. Sessions were 60-90 min in duration. Each participant sat at a computer station facing away from other participants¡¯ screens. The seating and monitor position allowed participants to view images of vehicle interiors as if they were seated in the driver¡¯s seat. Once participants were properly situated, the participants completed two practice trials. -6-   The experimental trials were organized into seven scenarios. Each scenario was based on a particular image of the vehicle interior. For each scenario, participants were first informed of the vehicle¡¯s state (turned off, turned on and stationary, driving on road), then a photo of the vehicle interior that reflected the vehicle state was shown on the computer monitor. For each photo, participants answered a series of questions about vehicle system status. Question order was counterbalanced within each scenario, with two presentation orders (and scenarios within each phase were also reversed). While participants completed each scenario at their own paces, the experimenter did not allow participants to begin the subsequent scenario until all participants were finished with the current scenario. Each scenario included a series of four to ten questions. There were a total of 40 questions across all seven scenario. For the pre-startup scenario, all of these questions asked about the presence or absence of a particular system in the vehicle. For the start-up and en-route scenarios, participants were first asked to identify any features not working properly, and then were asked about the status of individual features. The data collection system recorded the response time from the presentation of the question to the answer selection and confirmation. The participant then rated their confidence that their selected answer was correct using a 10-point scale. Following that, the participant was asked ¡°Where did you look for this information?¡± A photo of the vehicle interior was displayed on both the large monitor and the touch pad, and the participant used the stylus to point to the location on the touch pad. When the participant selected the location, a green circle centered on that location appeared on both displays. Figure 2 shows an example of the touch pad display with the location indicated by a green circle on both the touch pad and the large monitor.   Figure 2. Participant using stylus to indicate information location on touch pad  After the final scenario was completed, the experimenter moderated a discussion with the participants to learn more about their reactions to the features they saw in the photos. The discussion was unstructured, but generally addressed likes, dislikes, confusions, and suggestions for improvement. Discussions were typically 20 to 30 minutes in duration.       -7-  FINDINGS   There are several things to note about the following analyses. First, although participants were asked a variety of questions about real or fake systems and features, the current analyses focus on LDW, FCW, ACC, and BSW safety systems. Second, participants who were asked to read a vehicle¡¯s manual before the session were also given a brief quiz and questionnaire at the beginning of the session. The quiz was composed of five multiple choice questions based on recognition of general concepts in the manual. Nine participants did not answer at least two correct and were removed from subsequent analyses. Third, there were interactions in several cases, so main effects have to be taken with that caveat. Also, interactions were only analyzed or addressed up to the second order for space and complexity considerations. Fourth, the goal is not to make direct performance comparisons between the three included vehicles, but rather investigates participants¡¯ comprehension of particular features and DVI approaches. Fifth, given the nature of this study, significance criteria are presented at either p <.05 level of the p<.10 level. The latter level, while not being traditional in certain academic disciplines, is useful for identifying potentially meaningful findings that may be worthy of further investigation. Finally, the results presented in the sections that follow are organized by key dependent variable. Each section begins with a table showing analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for key main effects and two-way interactions. Results are then described in further detail. Because of the large number of analyses conducted, only select findings are described in these sections. See (1) for the full set of ANOVAs, F values, and interactions for key safety systems.  Comprehension Accuracy  Table 1 below shows p values for ANOVAs conducted using participants¡¯ accuracy in understanding the status displays of each of the four key safety systems, and overall across all safety systems. Blank cells in the table indicate p>.10. Mean percent correct responses by vehicle and manual condition are shown in Figure 3. The figure shows that despite overall low performance, participants in all vehicle conditions were more likely to provide correct responses about the FCW status displays if they had read the same vehicle¡¯s owner¡¯s manual.

Mean percent correct responses for all systems (with standard error bars)  Both Vehicle and Manual effects were robust for all safety items. Participants in the Volvo condition were the most accurate (M=65%), followed by the Infiniti condition (M=41%) and the Buick condition (M=32%), which was at chance (e.g., percentage correct if one guessed). Overall, participants were not accurate, regardless of prior manual exposure. There was an expected Manual effect, with participants gaining the most from having prior exposure to the manual of the same vehicle (¡°same¡± M=54%). Having no manual (M=41%) or a different manual (M=43%) resulted in poorer performance. Although there was a benefit to having the same manual as the vehicle being asked about, performance was still rather low across all vehicles regardless of manual exposure. In other words, having a manual helped, but not enough for participants to develop a good understanding of safety system presence or operation.  Participants were more accurate in the pre-startup phase (M=57%), where they were asked about the presence or absence of a system, than the other two phases (startup and en-route; M=37% and M=43%, respectively) which included questions of system activation and proper functioning. Note that the pre-startup phase contained 3 response options per question and the remaining two phases contained 4 response options per question. A large part of the significant Vehicle X Phase interaction is the result of Buick participants having a continual drop in accuracy from pre-startup, to startup, to the en-route phase. In contrast, the Infiniti and Volvo only show a drop after the pre-startup phase, but then level out.  In order to make the most direct comparison across phases, vehicles, and manual conditions, it is necessary to focus on the one system that was present in all vehicles and asked about during all phases: LDW. Figure 4 charts response accuracy for all LDW items across vehicle and manual conditions. In contrast to all other safety systems under consideration in this experiment, when focusing on the LDW system, participants were more accurate in both pre-startup (M=71%) and en-route (M=72%), but less accurate during startup (M=53%). This may indicate that the control button labeling in the pre-startup phase and the function/activation indicators in the en-route phase were easier to understand. For example, in the pre-startup phase, each vehicle had a clearly labeled button (using either acronyms or icons) to indicate the presence of an LDW system.  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Buick Infiniti VolvoMean Percent Correct ResponsesSame ManualDifferent ManualNo Manual-9-   Figure 4. Mean percent correct responses for LDW items only (with standard error bars)  There is a similar pattern of main effects and the same interaction for the LDW system as when all safety systems were analyzed. For example, having the vehicle¡¯s matching manual (M=77%) is more beneficial than having no manual (M=59%) or another vehicle¡¯s manual (M=61%). Interestingly, performance overall is higher for the LDW system than across all systems. The Vehicle main effect has a different pattern. Similar to the entire set of safety items discussed above, participants were most accurate in the Volvo condition (M=81%). In contrast, the least accurate participants were in the Infiniti condition (M=52%), with the Buick condition in between (M=64%). As shown in Table 1, these differences were significant (p<.05). Both Volvo and Buick utilize text to communicate if there is a malfunction with the system, which may be a reason for the higher accuracy of participants with those vehicles.  The Vehicle X Phase interaction for LDW is driven by the Volvo participants having high accuracy across all three phases, in contrast to the Buick and Infiniti participants showing a drop in performance during the startup phase (and then a recovery during the en-route phase). An interesting pattern seems to be occurring with the Infiniti. Performance is reasonably high in the pre-startup phase, where participants would need to recognize the presence of the system through the ¡°LDW¡± control button (M=59%). Performance then drops drastically to M=26% in the startup condition. This may be due to two issues: a) when the system is not functioning properly, the only indication is an orange icon of a car and lane lines in the speedometer (note that color of this icon is similar to the color of the ¡°on¡± indicator light on the LDW control button, which could be perceived as contradictory information), and b) when the system is functioning, the only indication is an orange light on the LDW control button which some participants mentioned during discussions as seeming to indicate a malfunction (¡°green for go¡± versus ¡°red for stop¡±). When asked where they found the information that let them know whether the system was on and functioning properly, participants overwhelmingly clicked on the location of the orange LDW icon, which indicates that participants understood that the icon indicated LDW system status, but that they did not understand its meaning (see Figure 5). Once participants began the en-route phase, performance with the Infiniti status displays increased to its highest level (M=70%). This may be the result of a green icon on the dash representing proper functioning.  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Buick Infiniti VolvoMean Percent Correct ResponsesSame ManualDifferent ManualNo Manual-10-   Figure 5. Image showing where participants indicated they found information about LDW functionality, with most clicks clustered on orange LDW icon in speedometer  Participants in the Infiniti condition demonstrated particularly low performance when asked about the BSW system (M=11%). This was probably due in large part to Infiniti not having a BSW system, and participants being reluctant to choose the N/A option. But the low performance is not just a matter of participants¡¯ reluctance to choose the N/A option during the start-up and en-route phases, because even in the pre-startup phase (where N/A is not an option) where participants are being asked about system presence, performance was quite low (M=21%).  The effect of Manual was not significant. Participants performed poorly (the highest mean, and for matching manuals, was only M=43%).  The results for ACC were similar to LDW and FCW, only with much lower overall performance regardless of manual condition. Participants were better able to identify the presence of ACC (first phase M=60%), than its proper functioning in the later phases (M=26% and M=29%). The Vehicle effect is driven by extremely low performance in the Buick condition (M=9%), which is likely the result of the Buick not having an ACC system and participants being reluctant to respond ¡°not applicable¡± (although performance is still quite low even in the pre-startup phase, M=14%, which is a simple question about presence/absence). The significant Vehicle X Phase interaction is also somewhat driven by this poor performance in the Buick condition, but is also a result of particularly strong performance in the pre-startup phase for Infiniti. Indeed, almost all participants identified the presence of an ACC in the Infiniti before startup (M=97%), which indicates a very clear understanding of the message ¡°CRUISE ON/OFF,¡± though it is not clear if participants were able to differentiate ACC from basic cruise control.  Confidence  Table 2 below shows significance levels for all main effects and two-way interaction effects conducted on participants¡¯ confidence ratings for each of the four key ACWS, and overall across all ACWS. The data used for these analyses include participants¡¯ responses for each of the seven sets of trials. Blank cells in the table indicate p>.10. Mean confidence ratings by vehicle and -11-  manual condition are shown in Figure 6. The figure shows that confidence overall is particularly high. Drivers were more confident than their knowledge warranted (regardless of condition).  Table 2.

The Vehicle X Phase interaction for all systems is driven by participants in the Volvo condition becoming more confident after the vehicle is started. That may be due to clear text information displayed at the startup and en-route phases, but only icon buttons displayed as an indication of system presence in the pre-startup phase. This shift is much less apparent in the Buick and Infiniti.    Figure 6. Mean confidence ratings for all systems (with standard error bars)  The Phase X Manual interaction seems to be the result of participants being more confident in the pre-startup phase with matched manuals, then when having no manual or a different manual. The effect of manual may be weakened in the later phases for vehicles which present clear text information about system functioning (e.g., Volvo).  Decision Time  Table 3 shows significance levels for ANOVAs conducted using participants¡¯ decision time for each of the four key safety systems, and overall across all safety systems. Any decision times less than 2 seconds or greater than 57 seconds were excluded from the following analyses (which 12345678910Buick Infiniti VolvoMean Confidence RatingSame ManualDifferent ManualNo Manual-12-  corresponds to the bottom 2.5% and top 2.5%, respectively). Blank cells in the table indicate p>.10. Mean decision time by vehicle and manual condition are shown in Figure 7.  Mean response times were fairly consistent across vehicle and manual conditions, with longer times in the Infiniti/No Manual condition and slightly shorter times in the Volvo/Same Manual condition.

Mean decision time in seconds for all systems (with standard error bars)  Participants took significantly longer to decide in the pre-startup phase (M=20.4 s) than in the startup (M=14.9 s) or en-route phases (M=11.1 s). There was a significant difference between decision times for participants in the Infiniti and Volvo conditions (M=16.9 s and M=14.0 s, respectively). This parallels the relative accuracy findings. There is not a significant main effect of Manual, although the decision time means show a trend in the expected direction of showing that participants without a manual responded slower than participants with the matching manual. The significant Vehicle X Phase interaction resulted from the larger decrease in decision time for Infiniti and Volvo from pre-startup to startup. The significant Phase X Manual interaction is driven by a larger decision time in the pre-startup condition for those who did not have a manual (M=22.1 s) compared to those who did have a manual (M=18.3 s). This difference in decision time was not evident in the startup and en-route phases. Furthermore, while the Phase X Manual interaction was significant when results for all evaluated safety systems were combined, there were no significant results (p<.05) when each safety system was analyzed individually 0510152025Buick Infiniti VolvoMean Decision Time in SecondsSame ManualDifferent ManualNo Manual-13-  Group Discussion Key Findings  This section describes some of the key findings of group discussions that were conducted. A more complete summary of group discussion findings organized by vehicle is presented in (1). ? Unfamiliar acronyms and icons were difficult to understand. Participants reported that many unfamiliar acronyms and icons were difficult to interpret without prior knowledge of their meanings. Many icons were seen as ambiguous. Some participants suggested that words should be used instead of, or in addition to, icons and acronyms. ? Color can be an effective cue if matched to users¡¯ mental models. Participants were accustomed to green meaning good or functional and red meaning bad or nonfunctional. Organization of controls and displays is important. Many participants commented that given the large number of displays and controls in the vehicles, it is important for manufacturers to organize and prioritize information.  ? Instruction manuals are helpful, but are no substitute for experience. Most participants who read quick start guides before their experiment sessions felt that this material helped them to understand vehicle features, but that there is no substitute for actual experience to help understand interfaces as complex as those in the vehicles used for this experiment.   Summary of Findings  Comprehension of presence and status.  Overall, individuals were not particularly accurate in assessing whether an ACWS was present (more than 40% of these responses were incorrect). This was consistent across all vehicles, systems, and whether or not the participant read a manual. Volvo and Infiniti participants were better at identifying system presence. Also, there was slightly better accuracy in identifying system presence (for some systems) when a participant read the appropriate manual, rather than no manual or another vehicle¡¯s manual. Participants were even less accurate when assessing system status (about 60% of responses were incorrect). Participants in the Volvo condition displayed better understanding of safety system status than for either Buick or Infiniti. In addition to the low overall accuracy levels, participants also took a relatively long time to recognize the status of a safety system. Participants tended to be confident in their responses despite a high rate of errors and long response times.  Vehicle owner¡¯s manual Familiarity.  Participants were more accurate when asked about the presence or status of a system if they had prior exposure to that vehicle¡¯s manual. Having a manual led to improved accuracy, but even with a manual, overall comprehension was still low. Participants in the Volvo condition who were given the Volvo manual had significantly higher accuracy than the other two vehicle conditions. Familiarity with the vehicle¡¯s manual led to somewhat more accurate and faster responding in the pre-startup phase, but not other phases. Overall comprehension rates for the ¡°no manual¡± and ¡°different vehicle¡¯s manual¡± conditions were quite similar (41% versus 43%, respectively) and both were lower than the ¡°same manual¡± condition (54%).  Information location.  Many participants who answered questions correctly did not select the correct location where they should have looked to determine the correct answer, which suggests that some participants who answered correctly may have done so by intuition or chance, may -14-  have recalled some information from a manual without being aware of location, or may have been led to the correct answer by an irrelevant cue. For instance, participants may have assumed that a vehicle had ACC if they saw information about cruise control in general. When participants selected the wrong location, it was often on the dashboard, which suggests that when in doubt, participants expected to find status information in this area. Conversely, some participants who answered incorrectly actually did look at the correct location to choose their answer, which suggests that these participants found the correct cue, but misinterpreted it.  Information presentation.  Having a clearly labeled button helped individuals identify the presence of a safety system. In contrast, not having a clearly labeled control button but rather a generic menu button can make system identification much more difficult. In addition, using intuitive icons or full-word text instead of acronyms appeared to improve understanding substantially. Volvo and Buick both used icons for LDW systems, and as a result seemed to produce faster recognition of system presence than was observed in the Infiniti, which used acronyms. Presenting system status information in full-word text seems to be more effective in facilitating understanding than using color coded icons if the color coding is not intuitive to drivers. The Volvo vehicle used the most text to communicate information, and also had the highest overall understanding by participants. In contrast, the Infiniti relied on color coded icons, and had the lowest comprehension, perhaps because the meanings of colors were in some cases ambiguous or counterintuitive to participants. In addition, the presence of text messages seemed to ameliorate the effects of not having a manual or having another vehicle¡¯s manual. The opposite was true for icon color codes. The Infiniti¡¯s placement of control buttons in the lower left hand corner below the steering wheel may be problematic to notice. Decision times were longer for the Infiniti in the pre-startup phase, indicating longer search/recognition times.  IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS  Based on the findings of the current experiment, there are several implications for standardizing and designing ACWS status display interfaces and information: ? Overall comprehension: There is a definite comprehension problem with vehicles containing unfamiliar ACWS systems, indicated by low comprehension rates and slow response times across all three vehicles used.  ? Vehicle owner¡¯s manual information: Reading manufacturer-provided information was somewhat helpful, but the problems definitely remained. Also, having read information about a different vehicle did not generally provide benefit. The limited improvement was vehicle-specific. ? Design issues: A variety of design issues may have affected comprehension and decision time.  o Displays were not always consistent with population stereotypes about where to find the information or how it is color coded. These population stereotypes were not always compatible with vehicle design in the case of certain icons or buttons. o Acronyms were difficult for people to use and varied from vehicle to vehicle. o Complete words as labels or in text displays yielded the highest comprehension, regardless of vehicle familiarity from reading the owner¡¯s manual. o Results do not imply that one particular manufacturer¡¯s approach is better than another¡¯s. However, the large differences among vehicles in participants¡¯ abilities -15-  to correctly answer the questions indicate that there should be some means of screening ineffective cases (e.g., performance benchmarks). ? Potential standardization advantages: Given the general comprehension problems and lack of transfer from reading the manual of one vehicle to understanding the status displays of another, standardizing some aspects of the status display may provide advantages. Potential areas for standardization are noted below: o Standardization of terminology for particular warning functions, so that text or acronyms based on them are consistent, may improve comprehension. Standardization of icons and color coding for status may also improve comprehension. These color codes or icons should be congruent with drivers¡¯ mental models (e.g., green indicating activated or properly functioning systems). o Status information should be located where people expect to see it. It is not clear to what extent this expectancy will be related to other aspects of the driver-vehicle interface, so location might have to be empirically determined/performance based for the vehicle, rather than there being a single preferred location for all vehicles. o Print materials do not seem highly effective in conveying knowledge about system status indications (although the present experiment¡¯s procedure was limited in that the participant did not have the vehicle present at the time they read the materials, and some print materials had little information about the ACWS features of interest in this experiment). There is a need for effective quick-overview materials that convey what safety systems are in the vehicle, how status is indicated, and how they operate. ? Further research questions: The present experiment revealed a variety of potential research questions that are potentially interesting to pursue. Several questions are: o What are the population expectations for message content, color coding, and display format (e.g., icons, text only, etc.)? o What are the population expectations regarding location of information? o Would there be a better understanding of comprehension and system confusion/advantages if individuals were recruited who actually drove one vehicle versus another instead of viewing photographic displays of the ACWS interface? o Would comprehension of the status displays change if the participants had become familiar with ACWS by driving an equipped vehicle over time?  ? Methodology and evaluation protocol: There are also several implications for further methodological refinement of the current task, design, and implementation of a standardized evaluation protocol for determining the comprehensibility of status displays: o It would be informative to experimentally compare specific design strategies. The present experiment selected vehicles based on general design tendencies (e.g., use of text for status versus icons/color), but these designs were not manipulated.  o The current experiment found that people were not particularly enlightened after exposure to information materials (e.g.., owner¡¯s manuals), although this may have occurred in part because the materials did not always cover the relevant information. It should also be noted that participants were not able to read the short manuals while also interacting with the vehicles. This may have impacted learning. Consequently, it is not truly possible to evaluate the information materials for quality and conveying information, so another investigation should develop and evaluate prototype informational materials (print and/or video). -16-  o The status display experiment used photographic mockups of actual vehicle interiors with near life size displays. Although this seemed sufficient for responding, ecological validity would have been increased if the current task took place within actual vehicles.   CONCLUSION  This experiment provided the opportunity to conduct new empirical research to address issues of ACWS DVI comprehension, based on visual cues.  There has been very little research on this issue. Based on the findings of this experiment, implications and recommendations were developed and discussed in detail. The findings presented in this report suggest that drivers would benefit from improved, more intuitive DVIs, and from some degree of standardization. Driver understanding of system status can be affected positively and negatively based on the design approach used to communicate important information about the ACWS. Manufacturers and regulators have agreed on standardizing interfaces, control buttons, and messages for a variety of non-safety critical or non-imminent situations (e.g., the recent Tire Pressure Monitoring System regulations). The current experiment indicates there is a need to further investigate standardization needs and design choices for ACWS, at least with respect to visual presentation of system status.  -17-  REFERENCES  (1) Emanuel Robinson, Neil Lerner, James Jenness, Jeremiah Singer, Rick Huey, Carryl Baldwin, David Kidd,  Daniel Roberts, & Chris Monk (2011). ¡°Crash Warning Interface Metrics Task 3 Report: Empirical Studies on Standardization Needs.¡± Interim report under Contract DTNH22-05-D-01002, Task Order 15.

 - 1 -  EVALUATION OF HAPTIC VELOCITY GUIDANCE ASSISTANCE SYSTEM    Feilong Yin, Ryuzo Hayashi, Pongsathorn Raksincharoensak, Masao Nagai  Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology  2-24-16 Naka-cho, Koganei-shi  Tokyo, 184-8588  +81-42-388-7419, 50010833206@st.tuat.ac.jp  ABSTRACT This paper describes a haptic velocity guidance system with the purpose of realizing better fuel efficiency and enhancing road capacity by using information from Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). By controlling the accelerator pedal reaction force, the proposed system provides a desired pedal stroke and guides the driver to achieve a desired velocity in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed haptic velocity guidance method is verified by experiments using Driving Simulator (DS) and the comparison with the other guidance HMI is presented via experimental results. The experimental results significantly show that the proposed haptic guidance, which provides high accuracy and quick response in velocity tracking, is a promising velocity guidance HMI.  INTRODUCTION Nowadays, the automobile is absolutely essential throughout the world. On the other side, fuel consumption and automobile carbon dioxide emission have become serious energy and environmental problems. To solve these problems, eco-driving and eco-traffic have got considerable attention in recent years. Some devices based on eco-driving have been utilized in practice such as Eco-indicator of TOYOTA (1), Coaching and Teaching System of HONDA (2) and Eco-Pedal of NISSAN (3). These systems cut down the waste of fuel of each vehicle by restraining uneconomical acceleration, particular when the vehicle starts moving.  - 2 - Another similar research is undergoing under EU research project HAVEit. A bus applied the concept of ¡°Active Green Driving¡± can use the right amount of energy according to the traffic environment, and lower the fuel consumption with around 30 percent compared with a traditional diesel engine (4). However, this research focuses on eco-traffic guidance. As a future technology, management of traffic flows with ITS information is considered to realize the entire eco-traffic (5~7). Fig.1 and 2 show the conceptual examples of the applications for such guidance. Fig. 1 shows that the host vehicle saves fuel by starting deceleration gently ahead of traffic congestion out of sight. Fig. 2 shows that a car is climbing up a slope. The driver may not notice the deceleration of own car which will cause traffic congestion. The velocity guidance system receives the warning and the suggestion of optimal speed from ITS infrastructure and guides the driver to recover the velocity quickly to avoid traffic jam. By conducting these, both fuel and time efficiencies can be improved obviously. Traffic flow control requires highly accurate velocity guidance. Former velocity guidance methods include visual method such as indicators in instrument panel or on screen display of car navigation system and audio methods such as voice navigation by a speaker. In realization of accurate velocity guidance, visual methods have an advantage that it can show quantitative and continuous information as an indicator, whereas an excessive gaze at the indicator may CongestionOwn carWe suggest decelerating to 40 km/h within 30s!60km/h40km/ht0 t0 + 30  Fig.1 Example of deceleration guidance application You have been slowed down,please recover your speed!60km/h40km/ht0               t0+ 15  Fig.2 Example of velocity recovering guidance application  - 3 - distract the driver's attention from ambient environment. On the other hand, frequent presentation of information may disturb the passengers' conversation or the enjoying of radio, though audio methods do not distract the driver's attention from the environment so much. Since the haptic guidance has no such shortcoming hence it is considered as the best way to accomplish velocity guidance.  In the aim of improving the fuel efficiency and traffic capacity, this paper proposes a high accurate velocity guidance system. By changing the characteristics of the pedal reaction force, the proposed system informs the driver of the desired pedal stroke to realize the ideal velocity in real time. An experimental system is installed in the DS of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT DS). Comparison experiments are carried out to examine the feasibility of this haptic HMI, in which visual guidance and aural guidance are used. The experimental results show that the haptic guidance can guide the driver to the ideal velocity with high accuracy and smallest volatility, which prove that the haptic HMI is promising velocity guidance HMI.

This system has three basic functions:  acquisition of ITS information, calculation of desired pedal stroke and  desired pedal stroke guidance by haptic pedal .  ACQUISITION OF ITS INFORMATION The system gets ideal velocity profile from the ITS infrastructures for the guidance in the practical use. Since this research is carried out with a driving simulatorand this paper intends to evaluate the proposed HMI, the accurate development of this function is not necessary. Accordingly, a 400 seconds desired (ideal) velocity profile based on typical driving is created to simulate this function ((a) of Fig.5).  CALCULATION OF DESIRED PEDAL STROKE The desired pedal stroke ( Pd) is calculated by two controllers: Ideal Pedal Stroke Calculator  (I.P.S.C ) and Velocity Error Feedback  ( V.E.FB ) controller. The I.P.S.C  is a feed-forward  controller. I.P.S.C is required to calculate the desired pedal stroke depending on the vehicle characteristics without consideration of slope, wind, etc. However, a complex I.P.S.C  itself is a very tough research which will cost a lot of time, considering the aim of this paper, the ideal pedal stroke profile which realizes the ideal velocity profile is roughly calculated offline from the velocity response characteristic of the TUAT DS. Sub-graph (b) of Fig. 5 shows the ideal pedal stroke PI. On the horizontal axis, the time instant at zero indicates the starting time of velocity guidance. From previous experiments, it is found that the velocity error ( Ve=V-VI) mainly contains two parts: random error and steady state error that is caused by environmental variation, human delay or mistake, etc. Thus, a PI control described as follow is utilized in V.E.FB :                      (Eq. 1 ) Here PFB  is  the adjusting pedal stroke, KP is the proportional gain, KI is the integral gain and s indicates the Laplace operator. Since the feed-back of velocity is mainly related to the vehicle driving performance, the optimal parameters of the V.E.FB  are observed from DS simulation. By comparing the accuracy of the actual velocity and the degree of fluctuation of the pedal stroke, the optimal set is: KP = 3 %(km/h) and the KI = 0.1%/s/(km/h). ( )IFB P eKP K Vs= + - 5 - DESIRED PEDAL STROKE GUIDANCE BY HAPTIC PEDAL The guidance will be accomplished by changing the reaction force of the haptic pedal. To realize the characteristics control of the pedal reaction force, an additional pedal reaction force generation mechanism is installed on the DS shown in Fig.6. The pedal is connected to an AC servomotor via mechanical linkages. A low inertia motor is chosen and no reduction gear is used so that the additional mechanism does not change the passive pedal characteristic much. Additional reaction force with maximum value 100N could be generated by this mechanism. The passive pedal reaction force characteristics without additional pedal reaction force is shown in Fig. 7, where lateral axis indicates the pedal stroke (the unit is ¡®%', varies from 0 to 100), and vertical axis indicates the reaction force. During stepping, the minimum force is 11N and the maximum force is 35N; during releasing the maximum is 22N and the minimum is 7N. The characteristic is different during stepping and releasing due to friction. The additional reaction force that guides the driver to desired pedal stroke is decided by two controllers:  Fixed Pedal Reaction Force Characteristic Controller  ( F.P.R.F.C.C ), and Pedal Stroke Error Feedback  ( P.S.E.FB ) Controller . The F.P.R.F.C.C  is designed according to the characteristics of passive reaction force and human stepping characteristics. The characteristic of F.P.R.F.C.C  is shown in Fig.8. Here lateral axis indicates the pedal stroke error ( Pe) which equals actual pedal stroke (Pa) minus desired pedal stroke ( Pd), vertical axis indicates the 0 100 200 300 40030405060708090VI [Km/h](a)0 100 200 300 40005101520PI [%]Time [s](b)Fig.5 Ideal profile of velocity and pedal stroke  MotorGas pedalBracketLinksMotorGas pedalBracketLinks Fig.6 Haptic accelerator pedal  Time [s]  - 6 - additional reaction force of F.P.R.F.C.C . There are two regions in additional reaction force: guidance region  (pedal stroke error is from -8% to +6%) and override region (pedal stroke error is over +6% or under -8%). The guidance region  is designed to guide the driver to the desired pedal stroke by providing a click feeling when the driver passes the desired pedal stroke (7). By studying the balance of the average stepping force, the passive pedal reaction force and additional reaction force, the reaction force is designed to be 15N when the actual pedal stroke equals to the desired pedal stroke, the largest additional reaction force is decided to be 35N. From the previous experiment result, the drop when the pedal stroke exceeds guidance region is decided to be -14N. P.S.E.FB  is proportional to the integration of the pedal stroke error ( Pe), and it is utilized to eliminate the steady state error of the pedal stroke. (Eq. 2 ) An experiment to find the optimal KPe  is carried out by 3 participants. By comparing the pedal stroke time history and the feedback of participants, KPe  is decided to be 4 N/%.  EXPERIMENTS FOR SYSTEM VERIFICATION  An evaluation experiment to verify the accuracy of haptic velocity guidance by pedal reaction force control and compare with other types of guidance is carried out with TUAT DS. Questionnaires are done to learn the subjective feeling of the proposed system. The participants' information is shown in Table 1.

GUIDANCE TECHNIQUE There are four types of velocity guidance used in this experiment: visual velocity guidance (V.visual ), audio velocity guidance ( V.audio ), visual pedal stroke guidance (P.visual ) and haptic pedal stroke guidance ( P.haptic ). A monitor is set in front of the instrument panel to achieve visual guidance (Fig. 9). The speaker of the TUAT DS is used to play the audio guidance and the haptic pedal mentioned above realizes the haptic guidance. (a)  V.audio : the audio guidance contains the information of desired velocity and the time duration of adjustment. For example, if ¡®Please accelerate to 60 km/h in 15 seconds' is played and the actual velocity is 40km/h, the driver should do his best to accelerate from 40km/h to 60km/h with an constant acceleration around 0.37m/s 2. (b)  V.visual (subgraph (b) of fig. 9): the green bar indicates the actual velocity and the yellow bar indicates the current desired (ideal) velocity (subgraph (a) of fig.5). During the guidance, the driver is instructed to follow the yellow bar as well as possible.  (c)  P.visual (subgraph (c) of fig.9): the green bar indicates the actual pedal stroke; the yellow bar indicates the desired pedal stroke  (as shown in fig.4) including velocity error feedback. (d)  P.haptic : the haptic guidance guides the driver to the desired pedal stroke only by controlling the pedal reaction force. The meaning of the reaction force variation is explained to the participants as follow: The force rises : the participant should release the pedal more. The force decreases: the participants should step the pedal more.  - 8 - EXPERIMENT SCENARIO In order to simulate the real driving situation, Metropolitan Expressway of Tokyo which has many curves is selected to carry out this experiment. The primary task is to keep the lane as usual. The task performance will be examined by checking the maximum value of the lateral displacement. Here lateral displacement is the distance from the host car gravity center to the lane's center. The secondary task is to follow the guidance (velocity or pedal stroke). Practice is executed before the experiment to make sure that every participant is familiar with the guidance methods. The ideal velocity profiles used in practice and experiment are different.

The line with different colors and marks indicate different drivers. The variety of displacements of every participant (except driver 2 and 7) is not obvious, almost in the region of 1m to 2m, which means that the  - 10 - 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 4000102030P [%](b) V.visual0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 4000102030P [%](a) V.audio  Desired valueActual value0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 4000102030P [%](c) P.visual0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 4000102030P [%]Time [s](d) P.haptic Fig.13 Pedal stroke time history of participant 3 01234567P.visual P.hapticPe_RMS [%]P_1P_2P_3P_4P_5P_6P_7P_8P_9 Fig.14 RMS of pedal stroke error of pedal stroke guidance and all participants  participants accomplished the primary task very well. The ranges of the values are different from participant to participant caused by individual difference. The lateral displacement data shows that the result of this experiment is credible. VELOCITY COMPARISON As an example, velocity time histories of participant 3 are shown in Fig. 11. Here (a) is the result of audio velocity guidance, (b) is the result of visual velocity guidance, (c) is the result  - 11 - of visual pedal stroke guidance and (d) is the result of haptic pedal stroke guidance. The vertical axis indicates the velocity (km/h), lateral axis indicates the time, the blue lines indicate desired velocity and the red lines indicate the actual velocity. The actual velocity of haptic guidance shows much better accuracy, smoothness in following the desired value and the reaction time is shorter than visual guidance and audio guidance as well.  Instead of showing all the time history of all the participants, the RMS of velocity error of all experiments is shown in Fig. 12, where the vertical axis indicates the RMS (km/h), lateral axis indicates the guidance. For all participants, the RMS of velocity error of haptic guidance is the smallest and nearly the same, which means haptic guidance suits this task very well. PEDAL STROKE COMPARISON Pedal stroke time histories of participant 3 are shown in Fig. 13. Here (a) is the result of audio velocity guidance, (b) is the result of visual velocity guidance, (c) is the result of visual pedal stroke guidance and (d) is the result of haptic pedal stroke guidance. The vertical axis indicates the pedal stroke (%), lateral axis indicates time; the blue lines indicate desired pedal stroke and the red lines indicate the actual pedal stroke. Here the desired pedal stroke of V.audio and V.visual is just a reference without velocity error feedback. The participants adjust the pedal stroke by themselves according to the velocity error (desired pedal stroke information is not presented to the participants). The desired pedal stroke of P.visual and P.haptic is the sum of ideal pedal stroke and adjusting pedal stroke according to velocity error. The result of haptic guidance is better than the result of visual pedal stroke guidance; it shows that the haptic guidance is much easier to follow. Comparing with velocity guidance, the pedal stroke of haptic velocity guidance is much smoother, which infers better fuel efficiency. During velocity guidance, the drivers are not required to follow the desired pedal stroke. Therefore only the RMS of pedal stroke error of P.visual  and P.haptic  is shown in Fig.14. It can be seen that the accuracy of P.haptic  of all participants are nearly the same, and much smaller than P.visual.  It can be observed that the effect of haptic device is much better than visual device from this experiment. QUESTIONNAIRES From the questionnaires, the characteristics of all guidance can be concluded as following:  (a)  V.audio : the desired value is easy to understand and the required attention paid to display is less than V.visual. However the checking of velocity is still necessary. In addition, the voice guidance, especially when high accuracy is desired, will disturb the conversation of  - 12 - the passengers or interrupt enjoying music which might make the passengers feel uncomfortable. (b)  V.visual : the desired value is easy to understand, but the attention paid to the environment will be distracted when the drivers check the velocity or accelerator pedal position information. So it is dangerous to be used for guidance which needs high accuracy.  (c)  P.visual : since the pedal stroke contains velocity error feedback, it varies much more frequently than velocity. As a result, more driving effort in tracking the desired pedal stroke is needed. The velocity guidance by this HMI is worse than V.visual and unrealistic. (d)  P.haptic : this guidance allows the driver to focus on the road which ensures the safety; and the changes of desired pedal stroke can be perceived easily. Since there is no instruction of desired velocity provided, the participants show nervousness caused by the distrust of the operation suggested by the guidance system. Finally, the reaction force seams a little strong when the driver wants to override. It should be studied further to improve the feeling of the proposed guidance.  CONCLUSION This paper proposes velocity guidance system by haptic interface-a haptic accelerator pedal. This system intends to realize better traffic efficiency by guiding the driver to drive with proper velocity.  A haptic pedal is designed and the haptic guidance maneuver is discussed while the other functions are neglected or simply developed.  Four types of HMI are applied in the comparison experiments carried out with TUAT DS. The experimental results show that the drivers finished the lane keeping task with nearly the same accurate. The haptic guidance method realized higher accurate velocity guidance than the other three. However, the comparison is not sufficient. In future research, comparison with other types of velocity assistance system, e.g. ACC, should be carried out as well. In future works, the feeling of haptic guidance has to be improved to make the override easier. Potential risk of guidance confusion will be further studied by providing more information such as desired velocity. In addition, the design of desired pedal stroke and the function of information reception should be carried out to complete this system.  In addition, this guidance system can be used in other assistance system that require velocity maneuver, e.g. lane changing assistance system. Since the reaction force of this haptic pedal can be controlled, it is possible to use this HMI in active accident avoidance systems, etc.   - 13 - REFERENCES (1)  Toyota Motor Corporation, News Release, ¡°Toyota to introduce Eco Drive Indicator, ¡± Available: http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/news/06/0929.html (2)  Y.

At the rem ote control, an operator remotely controls a vehicle using visual inform ation captured and transm itted by a cam era on the controlled vehicle without feeling the information related to vehicle motion, such as acceleration, vibration, and turning of the vehicle. Thus, the quality of visual information and consideration of the lack of sensory information about vehicle motion are important for the safe and efficient operation. of a vehicle. This study aim s to clarif y the dif ference in the driving behavior during direct driving and that while d riving a vehicle by remote control. In the first step of the study, the authors developed an experimental vehicle to evaluate the influence of visual information, and the relation ship betwee n the drivin g behavior and the quality of  visual inf ormation was  evaluated. In the second step, the authors developed a remotely controlled vehicle to compare the driving behavior during direct driving and that during remote driving; the driving behavior exhibited when there was no information with respect to vehicle motion was also evaluated.   INTRODUCTION There has been a great interest  in  the deve lopment of  inte lligent or auto mated highway systems that can improve safety, efficiency, and accessibility of transit services and the quality of highway travel. Current autom otive technologies for autom atic driving, however , have encountered problem s related to  sy stem relia bility, hum an factors,  an d the apportion of responsibility for accidents. Thus , it is currently dif ficult to bring fully autom atic driving systems for passenger vehicles into practical use.   Many significant studies have been reported on the remote control of vehicles such as military vehicles(1), m obile robots(2,3) , electric wheelchairs(4), passenger vehicles(5,6), and heavy-duty vehicles(7). Considering the rem ote control of passenger vehi cles, it is r elatively easy to remotely con trol a veh icle by an opera tor using a wireles s commutation system in comparison with controlling a vehicle fully automatically by an automatic driving controller. Moreover, the driver in the vehicle feels as if he or she is using an autom atic driving vehicle while it is being remotely controlled by the operator. Such a remote control has the potential to cope with com plicated situations because the vehicle is contro lled on the bas is of the perception and judgment of a human. Thus, remote control of vehicles can be used to enhance availability of automatic driving systems, parking systems(8), and platooning of trucks(9) and other such systems by performing the following functions: -2- ¡þ Helping or complementing automatic driving systems in a complex road environment, in which automatic driving control is difficult to operate; ¡þ Maneuvering passenger vehicles in parking areas;  ¡þ Maneuvering an unm anned truck toward a lead vehicle s o as to form  a platoon  at a logistics terminal.  This study focuses on the remote control of a vehicle as a complementary system of automatic driving, and investigates driv ing behavior under rem ote control at a low  speed (about 0¨C20 km/h). The reason why this study f ocuses on the low speed is that considering the rem ote control as a com plementary system of automatic driving, a low-speed operation suf fices for the above functions and that safe evaluations are possible. T wo factors of re mote control affecting driving behavior are investigated in the study.   One is the quality and condition of the supplie d visual inform ation. At the rem ote control station, an operator drives a remotely controlled vehicle using visual information captured and transmitted by a cam era on th e controlled vehicle. Therefore, the quality and con dition of visual information are important for safe and ef ficient operation, and it is important to clarify their effect on ease of remote control. For this purpose, an experimental vehicle is developed on the basis of a light electric vehicle. The experimental vehicle is designed such that it can be driven by both viewing the front-view i mages and direct vision. In these set of expe riments, driving behavior when following a preced ing vehicle and changing lan es is evaluated under various conditions of visual information such as view angle of the camera, image frame rate, size, and resolution.  The other factor is lack of sensory information about vehicle motion. At the rem ote control station, an operator drives a rem otely controlled vehicle without feeling vehicle motion such as acceleration, vibration, and turning of the ve hicle. F or the evaluation of th is lack of information, an on-vehicle rem ote station and a remotely controlled vehicle are developed. The on-vehicle remote station can control the base  vehicle and rem ote vehicle. In this set of experiments, driving behavior is evaluated by comparing the case wherein an operator at th e on-vehicle remote station drives the base ve hicle and that wherein the operator remotely controls the remote vehicle.  EVALUATION OF INFLUENCE OF QUALITY AND CONDITION OF VISUAL INFORMATION AT REMOTE CONTROL This section describes the evaluation of the in fluence of the quality and condition of visual information on driving behavior of an operator at  remote control. At the  remote control, an operator drives a rem otely controlled vehicl e using visual inform ation transm itted by a  camera on the controlled vehicle. Therefore, it is important to clarify the effect of the quality and condition of visual inform ation, such as view angle, im age frame rate, and size and resolution of the front-view images, for safe and efficient operation. The experimental vehicle, conditions, and results are described in the following subsections.  EXPERIMENTAL VEHICLE The experimental vehicle is developed for eval uating driving behavior when driving relying  on a camera and on direct vision. An overview of the vehicle and the vision devices installed on the vehicle are as follows.    -3- Overview of experimental vehicle The experimental vehicle is a modified light electric vehicle. Figure 1 shows the experimental vehicle, on which vision devices for the driver  and sensors are ins talled to measure driving behavior. The vision devices constitute an IEEE1394 camera for capturing front-view images, a PC for im age processing, and an LCD for displaying the im ages. A  laser radar , steering-wheel angle sensor, wheel speed senso r, gyro sensor, and an RTK-GPS are used for  measuring driving behavior. The laser radar m easures the inter-vehicle distance between th e experimental vehicle and the preceding vehicle. The RTK-GPS measures the precise vehicle position.

Experimental Vehicle  Vision devices for driving Vision devices for the driver consist of an  IEEE1394 camera, a PC and a 24-inch-wide LCD of screen size 518 ¡Á 324 [mm].   The IEEE1394 camera captures images of front scenes. The camera is horizontally mounted in front of the LCD at the sam e height as th e driver¡¯s eye position. In the experim ents, the view angle is varied by  adjusting the cam era lens. Figure 2 shows images of a p receding vehicle taken from the same position at different view angles.   The LCD is  mounted in front of the driver by removing the front window of the vehicle. Driving using direct vision can be evaluated by removing the LCD and the camera.  The images taken by the camera are sent to the PC and the processed images are displayed on the LCD. The frame rate, resolution, and image size displayed on the LCD are variable, th us driving using camera vision with various image qualities can be evaluated.  150deg 120deg 90deg 60deg  Figure 2.

Brief Overview of Evaluation Methods  Experimental conditions of visual information In the evaluation of driving behavior when dr iving using a cam era, two kinds of conditions that affect visual information are evaluated. One is the camera setting, that is, the view angle of the image. The other is the image quality, that is, resolution, frame rate, and image size.   In the experiments, view angles of 60, 90, 120, and 150 [deg] are tested. The param eters for the quality of the images displayed on the LCD are as follows: ¡þ Resolution: 640 ¡Á 480 [pixel] ¡þ Frame rate: 30 [fps] ¡þ Size: full size of the vertical direction of the 24-inch-wide display (432 ¡Á 324 [mm])  In the experiments under different image qualities, s ix variations of im age parameters from the basic condition are tested: ¡þ Basic condition: Angle of view: 120 [deg], Resolution: 640 ¡Á 480 [pixel], Frame rate: 30 [fps], and Size: full size of the vertical di rection of the 24-inch-wide display (432 ¡Á 324 [mm]);  ¡þ Condition A: Image resolution changed to 320 ¡Á 240 [pixel] ¡þ Condition B: Image resolution changed to 160 ¡Á 120 [pixel] ¡þ Condition C: Image frame rate changed to 15 [fps] ¡þ Condition D: Image frame rate changed to 7.5 [fps] ¡þ Condition E: Image size changed to 80% of the basic condition ¡þ Condition F: Image size changed to 40% of the basic condition  The experimental parameters of visual information are summarized in Table 1.

In the vehicl e-following scenario, the drivers of the experimental vehicle are instructed to follow a v ehicle in a way that they follow a v ehicle at their ordinary driving The preceding vehicle travels at velocities 5, 10, 15, and 20 [km /h] and the task of following a vehicle is tested. Inter-vehicle distances on a straight course of 50 [m] length are measured and evaluated.   In the stopping scenario, the drivers of the expe rimental vehicle are instructed to start 50 [m] behind a stopped vehicle and halt  behind it without colli sion, similar to the case in ordinary driving at stop and go. Inter -vehicle distances at the point wh ere the experim ental vehicle stops are measured and evaluated.  Experimental conditions of evaluation of driving behavior in lateral motion A lane-changing scenario is tested to evaluate driving behavior with respect to lateral motion. In the lane-changing scenario, the driver of the experimental vehicle is instructed to change lanes with a lateral disp lacement of 3.5 [m]. The experimental course is a straigh t lane of 7 [m] wide with white lines painted on both sides of the lane. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4, the course is divided into two lanes by stanchions placed at 1.25 [m] intervals. The leng th of the lane-changing zone is 10 [m], where the stan chions are rem oved. The driver is  instructed to travel along the right-side lane  and change to the left-side lane in the lane-changing zone with velocities 5, 10, 15, a nd 20 [km/h]. The position at which the lane change is started and the distance taken to change lanes are measured and evaluated.  In the experiments, the lane-change starting pos ition is defined as the vehicle¡¯s longitudinal position at the moment when the driver begins to  turn the steering wheel to change the lane. The distance taken to change lanes is defined as the longitudinal distance between the position of the vehicle when th e driver¡¯s steering angle is at the firs t peak and that when the driver¡¯s steering angle is at the second peak, as denoted by ¡®L¡¯ in the right panel of Fig. 4.   7[m]10[m]1.25[m]   Figure 4. Experimental Conditions of Evaluation of Lane Changing  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS This section explains th e results of evaluations  of driving behavior when driving using the camera. The results of vehicle-following, vehi cle-stopping, and lane¨Cchanging scenarios are described in the following subsec tions. In the experiments, four drivers (t hey are all m ale of 20¡¯s, and have driver¡¯s license) were tested, and the experimental results are expressed as the averages of the four drivers. Each driver wa s tested two times at each  condition using direct vision and was tested one time at each condition using camera vision.  Experimental results of evaluation of driving behavior in longitudinal motion Figures 5 and 6 show the experi mental results of evaluations  of driving behavior during -6- vehicle-following and vehicle-stopping scenarios.   Figure 5 shows the experim ental results of ve hicle-following and vehicle-stopping scenarios with different view angles. The results are expressed as a ratio on the basis of the inter-vehicle distance while driving using direct vision, that is, as L/Lc, where ¡þ Lc: Inter-vehicle distance when driving using direct vision at each velocity, and ¡þ L: Inter-vehicle distance when driving using a camera at each velocity and view angle.  The left panel of Fig. 5 shows the inter -vehicle distances in the vehicle-following scenario  with various view angles and at velocities 5, 10, 15, and 20 [km /h]. The results show that the inter-vehicle distance tends to be longer with a narrow view angle and shorter with a wide view angle. The right panel of Fig. 5 shows the inter -vehicle distances in the stopping scenario. The tendency of the result is the same as that of the vehicle-following scenario. The results show that the inter-vehicle distance in the vehicle-following scenario with a view angle of 120 [deg] and that in the vehicle-stopping sc enario with view angles 120¨C150 [deg] m atch the results of driving using direct vision.   Figure 6 shows the inter -vehicle distances for vehicle-following and stopping scenarios with different image qualities. The results are expressed as a ratio on the basi s of the inter-vehicle distance while driving using a cam era under the basic condition shown in Table 1, that is, as L/Lc, where ¡þ Lc: Inter-vehicle distance when driving using a camera under the basic condition, and ¡þ L: Inter-vehicle distance when driving using a camera with different image qualities.  The upper-left, upper-right, and lower -left panels of Fig. 6 show the in ter-vehicle distances during the vehicle-following scen ario at dif ferent im age re solutions ( conditions A and B  shown in T able 1), dif ferent frame rates (c onditions C and D), and dif ferent image sizes (conditions E and F), respectively. The results show that the inter-vehicle distance tends to be short at a low image resolution, long at a low frame rate, and short at a small image size. The lower-right panel of Fig. 6 shows the inter -vehicle distances for the stopping scenario at different im age qualities. The tendency of  the result is the sam e as that f or the vehicle-following experim ent. The results indicat e that th e influences  of fram e r ate an d resolution o n inter-vehicle distances are sm all, while the inf luence of  the im age size on  inter-vehicle distances is relatively large.

The star ting positions and lane-change  distances are evaluated. The definitions of these parameters are explained in the section ¡°Experimental Conditions.¡±   Figure 7 shows the starti ng positions and lane-change distan ces in the lane-change scenario with different view angles and at veloci ties 5, 10, 15, and 20 [km /h]. The results for the starting positions of the lane chang e are exp ressed as the relative positions of the starting positions when driving using a camera to thos e when driving using direct vis ion. A positive value indicates that the star t of lane change when using a cam era is earlier than that when using direct vision, and a negative value indicates that it is late r than that when  using direct vision. The results of the lane-c hange distances are expressed as  a ratio on the basis of the lane-change distances while driving using direct vision, that is, as L/Ls, where ¡þ Ls: Lane-change distance when driving using direct vision at each velocity, and ¡þ L: Lane-change distance when driving using a camera at each velocity and view angle. The results show that th ere is a  tendency of the start of a lane change  to be earlier and the distance of the lane change to be short at a narrow view angle. This implies that lane changing tends to be quick at a narrow angle of view . The results indicate that the starting position at view angles 90¨C120 [deg] and the lane-change distance at view angles 120¨C150 [deg] m atch the results for driving using direct vision.   Figure 8 shows the starting positions and lane-c hange distances for different image qualities. The results for the sta rting positions of the la ne changes are expressed as re lative positions with respect to the s tarting positions under the basic condition shown in Table 1. The results of the lane-change distances are expressed as a ratio on the basis of th e lane-change distance under the basic condition, that is, as L/Ls, where ¡þ Ls: Lane-change distance when driving using a camera under the basic condition, and ¡þ L: Distance for lane change when driving using a camera for different image qualities. The upper panels of Fig. 8 show t he starting pos itions of lane chang e for dif ferent image -8- resolutions (conditions A and B shown in Table 1), different frame rates (conditions C and D), and different image sizes (conditions E and F). The results show that the start of a lane change tends to be earlier at a low fram e rate, and it is not changed by varying resolution or im age size on the whole. The lower pa nels of Fig. 8 show the lane-c hange distances for dif ferent image qualities. The results under all conditions are approximately 1, which im plies that the distance of the lane change is barely af fected by the varia tion in im age qualities within the  experimental conditions.

Experimental Results of Lane Change with Different Image Qualities   Discussions of experimental results The above experim ents evaluate the influence of visual inform ation on driving behavior by comparing driving behavior when using a camer a and that when using direct vision. W hen driving at a velocity of less than 20 [km/h], the experimental results are as follows:  ¡þ Driving when using a cam era with a view an gle of about 120 [deg] results in driving behavior similar to that when driving using direct vision; and ¡þ The influen ces of the view angle and im age size (w hich are d ependent o n the configuration of the vision devices of the ca mera lens and LCD) on driving behavior are relatively la rge, while the inf luences of  frame rate and im age resolution (which  are dependent on the performance of wireless communication) are relatively small.  -9- EVALUATION OF INFLUENCE OF  LACK OF SENSORYINFORMATION ON  REMOTELY CONTROLLED VEHICLE MOTION This section describes the evaluation of the in fluence of lack of sensor y information about vehicle motion on the driving behavior of an operator at a rem ote control station. At the remote control station, an operator drives a remotely controlled vehicle without feeling vehicle motion such as acceleration, vibration, and turning of the vehicle. Thus, it is important to clarify the extent of the in fluence of this lack of sensory inform ation. The experim ental vehicle, conditions, and results are described in the following subsections.  EXPERIMENTAL VEHICLE The on-vehicle rem ote station and the rem otely controlled vehicle shown in Fig. 9 are developed by modifying the experimental vehicle and the light electric  vehicle described in the previous section. The on-vehicle rem ote station can control the base vehicle and rem ote vehicle such that driving behavior can be evaluated by com paring the case wherein an  operator at the on-vehicle remote station drives the base vehicle and that wherein an operator drives the remote vehicle. The on-vehicle remote station and the remote vehicle are explained below.   On-vehicle remote station Remote vehicleOn-vehicle remote stationRemote vehicle Figure 9. Experimental Vehicles  On-vehicle remote station The on-vehicle remote station is developed by modifying the experimental vehicle described in the previous section. An AC servo m otor is fixed for turning th e steering gearbox, and a steering-wheel-shaped input device is fitted by removing the existing m echanical steering wheel. The steering angle is controlled by setting the angle of the steering-wheel-shaped input device. A pedal-shaped input device is fitted in front of t he existing accelerator and brake pedals. Traction and brake forces are generated by controlling the traction motors¡¯ inverters of the vehicle according to the angles of the pedals of the pedal-shaped input device.   A network cam era is mounted instead of the IEEE1394 cam era in the sam e position. The angle of view of the network ca mera is 140 [de g], and the resolution is 640 ¡Á 480 [pixel]. Images from the network camera can be sent via a wired LAN and displayed on the LCD.   The on-vehicle remote station has two control modes: self-control and remote-control modes. In the self-control m ode, the image of the network cam era mounted on the base vehicle is displayed on the LCD. The steerin g angle as we ll as traction and b rake forces of  the base  vehicle are controlled according to the angles of the steering-wheel-shaped and pedal-shaped input devices. In the rem ote-control m ode, the im ages c aptured by the network cam era -10- mounted on the remote vehicle are received via the wireless LAN and displayed on the LCD. Information about the motion of th e remote vehicle is also received  from the remote vehicle for displaying it to the operator and for controlling the r eaction torque of the steering-wheel-shaped input device. In formation about the angles of the steering-wheel-shaped and pedal-sh aped input devices is sent to the rem ote vehicle via the wireless LAN. The base vehicle does not move when in the remote-control mode.    Remote vehicle The remote vehicle is developed using the sam e type of light electric  vehicle as the base vehicle of the on-vehicle remote station. The configuration of the remote vehicle is almost the same and the network cam era, AC servo m otor, and controller are the s ame as those for th e base vehicle of the on-vehicle remote station. The steering angle and traction and brake forces of the vehicle can b e contro lled accord ing to inform ation about the ang les of the steering-wheel-shaped and pedal-shaped input devices sent from the on-vehicle remote station via the wireless LAN. The delay in control information is less than 50 [ms]. Images taken by the network camera and vehicle m otion information about the rem ote vehicle are sent to the on-vehicle remote station via the wireless LAN. In the developed vehicles, the delay in image reception is about 200  [ms], the sam e as in th e self-control mode. Therefore, the delay in image reception is m ainly caused n ot by data transm ission via wireles s LAN but by im age processing.   EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS In the experim ents, driving behavior with re spect to lon gitudinal an d latera l motions in  self-control and remote-control modes are measured and compared as shown in Fig. 10. For  the operator, the difference between the self-control mode and remote-control mode is lack of sensory information about vehicle motion, becaus e the system  configurations, im age delay, and data transm ission delay at the rem ote vehicle are alm ost the sam e as those at the base vehicle of the on-vehicle remote station.

Brief Overview of Evaluation Methods   In the experiments, the vehicle-following scenar io at velocities 5, 10, and 15 [km /h] and the vehicle-stopping scenario are tested to evaluate  driving behavior with respect to longitudinal -11- motion, and the lane-changing scenario at velocities 5, 10, and 15 [km/h] is tested to evaluate driving behavior with respect to lateral m otion. The experimental course and the evaluation items are the sam e as those explained in the pr evious chapter. In the self-control mode, the operator is instructed to follow a vehicle, stop, and change the lane using the base vehicle of  the on-vehicle remote station, similar to the experiments described in the previous chapter. In the remote-control mode, the operator is instructed to remotely control the vehic le from the on-vehicle remote station and follow a vehicle,  stop, and change the lane using the rem ote vehicle.   EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The following are the experimental results of driving behavior in vehicle-following, stopping, and lane-changing scenarios. In the experim ents, four drivers (they are all m ale of 20¡¯s, and have driver¡¯s license) were tested on each scenario, and the experimental results are expressed as the averages of the four drivers.   Experimental results of evaluation of driving behavior in longitudinal motion Figure 11 shows the experimental results during the vehicle-following and stopping scenarios. The results are expressed as a ratio of inter-vehicle distance in the remote-control mode on the basis of that in the self-control mode, that is, as L/Lc, where Lc: Inter-vehicle distance in the self-control mode, and L: Inter-vehicle distance in the remote-control mode. The experimental results show that the inter-vehicle distances in the remote-control mode are almost the same as those in the self-control mode.    Figure 11. Experimental Results of Vehicle-Following and Stopping Scenarios in Remote-Control and Self-Control Modes  Experimental results of evaluation of driving behavior in lateral motion Figure 12 shows the expe rimental results of the lane-changing scenario. The results of th e starting positions of the lane chang e are exp ressed as the relative positions of the starting positions in the rem ote-control mode to those in the self -control mode. The results of  the lane-change distances are expressed as a ratio on the basis of the lane-change distances while driving in the self-control mode, that is, as L/Ls, where Ls: Lane-change distance when driving in the self-control mode, and L: Lane-change distance when driving in the remote-control mode. The results show that the start of a lane change in the remote-control mode tends to be earlier than that in the self -control mode, and that th e lane-change distances in the rem ote-control mode are almost the same as those in the self-control mode.  -12-  Figure 12. Experimental Results of Lane Changing in Remote-Control and Self-Control Modes  Discussions of experimental results The above experim ents evaluate the influence of lack of sens ory information about vehicle motion by comparing driving behavior when dr iving without sensory information on vehicle motion (remote-control m ode) and that when dr iving with sensory infor mation on vehicle motion (self-control mode). W hen driving at  a ve locity of  less than 15 [km /h], the experimental results show that the influence of lack of sensory inform ation at the rem ote control station is small because driving behavior with and without sensory information about vehicle motion is almost the same overall.   CONCLUSIONS Driving behavior at the rem ote control station for a vehicl e moving at a low speed (about 0¨C20 km/h) was investigated based on the premise that the remote control of a vehicle has the potential to complement automatic driving systems. To clarify the difference between driving behavior in direct driving and that in rem ote contro l, ex perimental vehicles th at enab le comparative evaluations of driving behavior were developed. The influences of visual information and lack of sensory inform ation about vehicle motion on driv ing behavior at the remote control station were clarified by the experimental results.

Therefore, it is  crucial to consider when and where a system  should prov ide information to a driver with the least amount of distraction. Unfortunately, current guidelines for in-vehicle systems do not consider the driving workload. We describe a method of quantifying the driving workload and setting five discrete driving workload levels (DWLs) by simple vehicle signal data, using subjective measurement, in order to offer criteria for distraction-minimized systems on ITS. We verified the efficiency of the DWL, and we propose directions for new regulations based on the DWL.  KEYWORDS Workload, Subjective measure, NASA-TLX, Quantification, Vehicle signal data, Telematics, ITS, Multiple Linear Regression analysis, Regulation, Guideline, JAMA  INTRODUCTION Various kinds of intelligent transportation systems have become available with the s pread of both in-vehicle networks and wireless communica tions, and the advancement of sensors. The in-vehicle information system has evolved from  a mere car navigation system that provides route guidance and traffic information, to a telematic system that provides such information as up-to-date POI information, internet radio, podcast, tweets provided by twitter, and other web 2 contents. A  nom adic device such as a sm art phone or a PND can also provide such information in a car . For driving safety , intelligent warning system s (e.g., lane departure warning systems and intelligent speed advice systems) are m ounted in som e luxury cars. However, a driver may be distracted by these systems, which require additional workload for processing the information provided by either a display or a sound. The driving workload can vary significantly, depending on the driving situation (e.g., w hen a driver is about to m ake a turn or is simply keeping the vehicle in the lane). Therefore, it is crucial to consider when and where a system should provide information to a driver with the least amount of distraction (1, 2, and 3). Unfortunately , the current guidelines for in-vehicle system s (4, 5, and 6) do not address this problem. In order to develop criteria  for an intelligent transportation system that minimizes distraction by m anaging workload for all the cars, we use  vehicle signal data to quantify the constantly changing driving workload. After reviewing related works and curren t guidelines for in-vehicle systems, we describe in this paper the quantification of the driving work load and its applica tion. We also describe a method of quantifying the driving workload and converting it into  discrete driving workload levels (DWLs) for application to new regulat ions. Finally, after verifying the DWL, we propose directions for the regulation of ITS services, based on the driving workload.  RELATED WORKS Driving workload management systems (i.e., workload managers) have been researched and  developed (7, 8). The workload m anager, whic h attem pts to deter mine if a driver is  overloaded or distr acted, has alter ed the availability of  telem atics a nd the oper ation of  warning systems. Workload managers can re duce the num ber of tele matics-induced crashes and significantly enhance the ef fectiveness of warning system s (1). Som e European funded projects, such as COMUNICAR (IST-1999-11595) and AIDE (IST-1-507674-IP), focused on the driver-vehicle interface. COMUNICAR proposed the first ru le-based system and tested  the ef fectiveness of th e con cept of inform ation m anagement. AIDE defined a generic evaluation m ethodology for the system s and pres ented the architecture of adaptive and integrated driver-vehicle interface. T akahashi et al. dis cussed guidelines for voice-activated  telematic services regarding dialog m anagement corresponding to the driving workload (2). They proposed that the system  permit a service only when the driver ca n afford to do other work while driving, and that the workload of  the service be within the driver ¡¯s lim its. However, they evaluated its validity using only a questionnaire and indicated neither a measurement method nor a criterion for the workload (3). Measurement of the driving workload, which has been researched since the 1960s (9), can be divided roughly into the thre e categories: subjective m easures, physiological m easures, and performance m easures. Subjective m easures assess the workload u sing se lf-reports by  3 subjects and can be split into multidimensional measures and unidimensional measures. The NASA Task Load Inde x (NASA-TLX) is a ty pical multidimensional subjective workload measure (10). However, it is difficult to apply the NASA-TLX to the workload m easure of a continuously changing driving task , where the driver m ust evaluate six subjective factors (Mental dem ands, Physical dem ands, T emporal dem ands, Perform ance, Ef fort, and Frustration) and m ake pair -wise com parisons of the six subjective f actors, in order to determine a NASA-TLX value of a single task. The Rating Scale for Mental Effort (RSME) is often used as a unidim ensional measure (11). The RSME has a un ivariate rating scale that ranges from 0 to 150 and has nine descriptive indicators along its axis (e.g., ¡°almost no effort¡± and ¡°extreme effort¡±). Validation of this measure ensures that the meaning of the verbal labels is the same for dif ferent people. A  unidime nsional measure is more sensitive than a multidimensional measure in detecting short periods of the elevated workload that often occur during driving (12). The advantage of subject ive m easures is high validity . A subject is subjectively aware of the workload even be fore performance degradation occurs (13). However, these measures cannot be used for workload management in actual vehicles because they require an overt report from  a driver. Physiological measures derive the workload from the driver¡¯s physiology. Different physiological measures are differentially sensitive to arousal (e.g., pupil diameter) or to specific stages of information processing (e.g., the evoked cortical brain potential). For example, Itoh et al. pres ented a method of estimating driving workload using physiological indexes in real time (14). They adopted multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis to model the NASA-TLX as the true  workload m easurement using physiological indexes (e.g., head rotation, pupil size, and hear t rate). They evaluated their m odel using a driving simulator and obtained a good correlation. The advantage of physiological measures is that they do not require an overt response by a driver . Moreover, most of these measures can be collected continuously. However, some physiological measures (e.g., heart rate variability) are not suitable for detecting short periods of  elevated workload because some physiological states may continue for a period of  time (12). Mo reover, an invasive sensor interf eres with driving, and the additional cost of a noninvasive  sensor hinders its m arket penetration. Performance m easures are based on the theo ry of  lim itation in h umans¡¯ inf ormation processing capacity. A human has several dif ferent pools of cognitive resources that can be tapped simultaneously . In a multitask environm ent, a hum an processes inf ormation sequentially when the workload for each task requires the same resources (15).  Performance m easures are either prim ary task  perform ance m easures or secondary task performance measures. Primary task performance measures can be used under the assumption that an increment of task load reduce s performance. Obviously, driving tasks require certain workloads, depending on the driver ¡¯s state and circumstances. For example, Kantowitz et al. measured driver respo nses to co mbinations of  telem atic device s and assess ed driving  performance degradation (8). Secondary task m easures assume that increased work load for 4 one task can be indicated by the perform ance level of secondary lo w-priority tasks. A secondary task m ust interact with a prim ary task, thus causing ove rlapping resources. For example, Lee et al. us ed braki ng behavior to evalua te th e effect of a graded alert for a collision warning on a driver ¡¯s performance (16). The advantage of perform ance measures is that they are objective quantitative m easures and are relatively easy to obtain by vehicle signal data when measuring driving performance. Many countries and organizations have established guidelines to reduce driving workload and ensure both effective and efficient use of ITS services provided visually and auditorially. The guideline for In-vehicle Display S ystems Version 3.0 designed by the Japan Autom obile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) is very prescriptive about the design of the system (4). It regulates the content of inform ation to be displayed and the m ethod of the display system  operations. However, JAMA emphasizes in its m agazine (17) the n ecessity to improve these guidelines. First, the descripti on of prohibited m atters must be changed from enumerative to quantitative. Second, auditory information must be provided to the driver when a vehicle is in motion. Third, it is necessary to evaluate the di straction of infor mation-providing services whose contents are produced by a third part y (e.g., those produced by a telem atics service provider and internet contents), since it is difficult to confirm if they satisfy guidelines while it is easy to confirm  i f the contents of a car navigation system  satisfy them . European guidelines are not regulations but recommendations (5). These guidelines refer not only to car navigation systems but also to all inf ormation communication systems, and they refer mainly to regulations of philosophy , which are dif ferent from Japanese prescriptive guidelines. The American guidelines of  the Allian ce of  Automobile Man ufacturers (AAM) are based on European guidelines (6). They state that a vi sual or visual-manual task intended for use by a driver while a vehicle is in m otion should be designed to m eet the cr iteria of single-glance duration and the maximum task completion duration. Unfortunately, these guidelines indicate only two driving states, stop and in motion, to distinguish the driving workload. They are not sensitive to dif ferences in workload am ount, such as the dif ference between a stop in the middle of a left turn and a stop while waiting for a signal to change, or the difference between driving on a wide straight road and driving on a street in the m iddle of a city. Therefore, in order to distinguish D WLs, we pr opose the quantification of driving workload based on a subjective measure that has high validity, using vehicle signal data as an objective measure of workload that is available in many vehicles.  QUANTIFICATION OF DRIVING WORKLOAD AND APPLICATION TO ITS We aim to quantify the workload required for a primary driving task in an ordinary drive by an ordinary driver , in order to provide guide lines f or a driving inf ormation service with  minimal distraction. Workload is determined under the following assumptions. First, we use a 5 restricted subjective measurement by asking d rivers to set workload v alues in an ordinar y drive by an ordinary driver for different driving situations. Drivers are  asked to s et a high  workload value for a situation that people wo uld generally regard as high. For exam ple, turning when a car is coming from ahead is generally considered to be a demanding maneuver that requires control as far as general driving knowledge is concerned. Therefore, drivers should rate this task as requiring a high work load even though an individual skilled driver may have no problem completing it. Although this quantification may seem too simplistic, it eliminates bias due to other factors (e.g., fatigue , driving skill, and driver ¡¯s proficiency on a  particular road and in a par ticular area), and both JAMA  and other countries¡¯ guidelines eliminate these factors. Second, in order to quantify the driv ing workload, we use vehicle signal data, but not the driver ¡¯s physiological data (e.g., head rotation, pupil size, heart rate variability, EKG, EMG, respiration, and GSR) (9). Acquiring the driver ¡¯s physiological data requires special sensors and therefore lim its our proposed information service availability. In addition, it is dif ficult to use the driver ¡¯s physiological signals to quantify the driving workload when individual variations in a driv er¡¯s physiological signals are lar ge. Third, we  use the vehicle signal data that can be easily acquired in almost all cars (e.g., velocity, steering angle, turn signal,  and inte rsection information). We do not use data that require a special sensor that is not installed in m ost cars (e.g., camera, radar and yaw rate sensor). To simplify the workload measurement, we exp ress continuous workload values as f ive discrete levels (i.e., DW Ls) tha t a re easie r to  apply to a distr action-minimized ITS service. Figure 1 summarizes the driving workload quantification based on analysis of the relationship between vehicle signal data and conti nuous subjective m easurement, use of DWL, and exam ples of ITS services using DWL. Such applications as face designed DWL indicator may be required for in-vehicle systems to inform drivers whether or not they can perform the operations.  Fig. 1. Driving Workload Level (DWL) Quantification and Applications to ITS  QUANTIFICATION OF DWL First, we choose vehicle signal data that is  relevant to the workload and determ ine the threshold for setting the DWL using MLR analysis. We do not determine the DWL simply by 6 setting thresholds of the value calcu lated by MLR analysis because ch ange in each vehicle  signal data has m eaning. Second, considering  th e thresh old of each vehicle sig nal data relevant to the workload, the DWL is finally calculated. MLR Analysis Using Vehicle Signal Data We adopt MLR analysis in order to determ ine which vehicle signal data variables are highly relevant to the driving workload and to determ ine the threshold used to convert the continual driving workload value into the five discrete DWLs. We can obtain various types of ordinary vehicl e signal data from such vehicle¡¯s Local Area Network (LAN) as Control Area Network (CAN). We classify vehicle signal d ata into three hierarchical levels of car driv ing tasks: strategic, m aneuvering, and control (18). W e aim to quantify the workload required for a prim ary task in an ordinary drive by an ordinary driver . Workload generally involves command of a maneuver and control in terms of general driving knowledge. The strategic level (e .g., setting a destination on a car¡¯s navigation system ) is considered to be a secondary task. Therefore, we choose vehicle signal data considered to be relevant to the m aneuvering level and the cont rol level. The vehicle signal data that is considered to influence the driving workload can be classified based on the literature (18). Vehicle signal data of the m aneuvering level in clude ¡°turn signal,¡± w hich is related to the driver¡¯s operation, and ¡°in an intersection,¡±  ¡°distance to an intersection,¡± ¡°type of  intersection,¡± ¡°road type,¡± and ¡°curvature radius,¡± which are related to the navigation system. Vehicle signal data of the contro l level include ¡°accelerator pedal,¡± ¡°b rake pedal,¡± ¡°steering angle,¡± and ¡°deriv ative of steering angle,¡± whic h are related to the driver ¡¯s operation; and ¡°velocity,¡± ¡°acceleration,¡± ¡°deceleration,¡± and ¡°automatically changed gear level,¡± which are related to vehicle motion as a result of the driver¡¯s operation. Continuous Subjective Measure In order to quantify the constantly changing  driving workload, we attem pt to obtain  a continuous subjective measure based on the NASA-TLX. Examination of NASA-TLX of a primary driving task The driving workload that we intend to quantify is based on general driving dem ands, excluding the driver¡¯s individual factors (e.g., fatigue, driving skill, and proficiency level for a particular road or area). Therefore, we exam ine the weig hted value of six factors of the  NASA-TLX under the following conditions. (A) Driver is not fatigued and is in good mental and physical condition. (B) Driver is not busy and is not concerned about time. (C) Driver concentrates on driving only and is not disturbed by the scenery outside. The 7 driver is not engaged in conversation, and the car audio is turned off. Under these conditions, it has been determ ined that of the six subjective factors of the NASA-TLX, ¡°Mental demands¡± and ¡°Effort¡± are highly dominant, and that the other factors can be ignored. The reason m ay be that an ordinary drive by an ordinary driver requires ¡°effort¡± based on the driving technique learned from experience, and th at ¡°mental demands¡± are required to make the ¡°effort.¡± Subjective workload measurement of primary driving tasks We acquired continuous subjective measurement of the workload in the following experiment. Drivers who satisfied conditions  (A) and (B) drove on particul ar courses about which they had been informed in advance, after being in structed that they would drive under co nditions (A), (B), and (C). Imme diately after driving, th e drivers were asked to watch a front screen video captured while they were driving, and to  indicate the driving workload values required for a prim ary driving task in an ordinary dr ive by an ordinary driver , ranging from 0 (no driving workload) to 100 (extrem ely high driving workload), constantly using a rotary knob as the video proceeded. W e acquired a subj ective workload m easure every 0. 1sec. We instructed the drivers to set continuous values, noting only ¡°Mental demand¡± and ¡°Effort.¡±   EVALUATION Design of the Driving Workload Model Results of MLR Analysis MLR attempts to model the relationship between n explanatory variables nxxx ,,, 21 ¡þ¡þ¡þ  and a dependent variable y  by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

In this MLR analysis, explanatory variables nxxx ,,, 21 ¡þ¡þ¡þ  are the vehicle signal data, and a dependent variable is a continuous subjective measurement. The experiment to acquire continuous subjec tive workload measurement of primary driving tasks was conducted using five drivers in nine different courses of local roads, which take 20 to 60min, in the daytime in fine weather. We acquired continuous subjective data for 15 drives. We acquired m ore than 300,000 samples of subj ective workload m easurements and vehicle signal data, because we acquired them every 0.1sec. 8 We designed an MLR model of  the driving workload as )2(equation , using vehicle signal data independent of each other . We also calculated th e correlation between ind ependent variables. In the MLR analysis, we modified the difference in scaling of 15 data points in advance, comparing the relationships among values of continuous subjective data and driving scenes. In addition, 11x , 12x  and 13x  were appropriately converted to functions so that they could be changed linearly with the DWL and so that in tercept 0¡þ  could be 0.

Next, we define the maximum discrete 9 value maxW as level 5 and the m inimum discrete value 0 as level 1.

Third, we determ ine the threshold using iR . The DWL for keeping a vehicle in a lane is determ ined by adding hyste resis control to the thr eshold (Fig. 3). The  ranges and thresholds of all the vehicle signal data are determined in the same way. The DWL is determined by using all the ranges a nd thresholds of all the vehicle signal data. Basically, the final workload level is determined as an increm ent of contributions of all the vehicle signal data from the lowest level (i.e., DWL=1) to the highest level (i.e., DWL=5).  Fig. 3. DWL When Keeping a Vehicle in a Lane Verification of Precision of the DWL In the following experim ent, we verified th e precision of  the DW L for application to regulations for providing infor mation. We designed the regulations based on DWL, priority , and cognitive load of infor mation and operations (Fig. 4). After the drivers had driven on a particular course (Fig. 5), we explained to the m the regulati ons regarding what infor mation could be provided and what operation could be allowed on each DWL. The drivers were then asked to watch the application (Fig. 6), whic h included a front screen video captured while they were d riving and the statuses  of ¡°veloc ity,¡± ¡°acceleration o r deceleration,¡± ¡°steering angle,¡± and ¡°turn signal.¡± They were asked to set the DWL for a prim ary driving task in an ordinary drive by an ordinary driver, based on the regulations. The drivers could confirm their 10 set DWL using the face-designed workload indi cator (Fig. 6). W e acquired the d rivers¡¯ set DWLs and the calculated DW Ls every 0.1sec . The experim ent was conducted using nine drivers on the same course of local roads (Fig. 5), in the daytime in fine weather. We acquired 151,660 samples of the drivers¡¯ set DWLs, the calculated DWLs, and the distribution of the drivers¡¯ set DWLs (Fig. 7).

Here, we propose directions for new regulations based on DWL, priority, and cognitive load of information and operations (Figs. 10 and 1 1), in order to address p roblems with the cur rent guidelines for in-vehicle system s. Figure 10 indicates the method of classifying the content of information to be displayed and the method of display system operations, based on priority and cognitive load. The priority is decided by such classification as warning inform ation (high priority), route guid e information (medium priority), and multimedia information (low priority). Cognitive load can be determined by the length of contents based on current standards (e.g., the occlusion method (ISO16673), and the AMM guideline (6) in which it is claimed that single glance durations must not exceed 2sec). Figure 11 indicates the timing of starting and stopping the content, based on DWL. Compared with JAMA guideline (4), the regulations based on DWL have both more restricted cases (e.g., Short Multimedia contents can be started wh en DWL is less than 2, and m ust be stopped when DWL is m ore than 4.) and more relaxe d cases (e.g., Long W arning contents can be started when DWL is less than 3, and must be stopped when DWL is 5.).  Fig. 10. Classification of contents        Fig. 11. Timing of Starting and Stopping  CONCLUSION We described a m ethod of quantifying the driv ing workload and setting the DW L by simple vehicle signal data, using c ontinuous subjective measurement based on the NASA-TLX. W e verified the ef ficiency of the DW L and prop osed directions for new regulations based on DWL, priority, and cognitive load of information and operations in order to address problems with the current guidelines for in-vehicle systems on ITS. W e will eva luate the regulations proposed in the previous chapter by applying act ual ITS services both on local roads in the daytime in fine weather and on expressways, at night or in wet weather.

 1 HIGHWAY CAPACITY INCREASES  FROM COOPERATIVE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL  Steven E. Shladover* Dongyan Su Xiao-Yun Lu   California PATH Program University of California, Berkeley 1357 South 46 th  Street, Building 452 Richmond, CA 94804, USA *Tel.: +1-510-665-3514 *Email:  steve@path.berkeley.edu   ABSTRACT   Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) enables drivers to follow each other at shorter gaps than autonomous ACC, and our recent field test demonstrated that drivers are favorably inclined toward using those shorter gaps.  In this paper, we simulate multi-lane highway traffic conditions with a variety of combinations of conventional manual driving, ACC, ¡°here I am¡± and CACC vehicles to determine the maximum effective capacity achievable in each scenario.  The distribution of gaps used by the ACC and CACC vehicles in the simulations is matched to the distribution of gaps that drivers from the general public selected in our field test, providing the most realistic estimates to date of the potential highway capacity benefits of ACC and CACC.  Keywords  : Adaptive cruise control Cooperative adaptive cruise control V2V cooperation Highway capacity  ITS benefits   MODELING APPROACH  There have been multiple prior efforts to predict the effects that adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems could have on highway traffic flow capacity and stability.  Some of the most widely cited such efforts, in physics journals, have adopted over-simplified models of driver behavior and have treated the vehicles as molecules obeying simple physical laws rather than as objects under human control.  These have produced unrealistically optimistic estimates of traffic flow improvements.  Here, we adopt a state-of -the-art model of driver behavior in congested traffic, from the NGSIM program, and select the distribution of vehicle-following gaps for the ACC and CACC systems based on the gaps that were actually chosen by drivers in our field testing of these systems, in order to produce the most realistic possible estimates of traffic impacts.  Traffic modeling has always been challenging because of the diversity and complexity of the decision making processes that govern how drivers follow the vehicles ahead of them  2 and how they change lanes or respond to other drivers' attempts to change lanes.  These aspects of driver behavior have been dealt with recently in the Federal Highway Administration's NGSIM (Next-Generation SIMulation models) program (1), where video traces of the trajectories of all the vehicles in a congested highway traffic stream were analyzed to characterize vehicle following and lane changing (including the perspectives of both the lane-changing driver and the adjacent drivers who must decide how readily to yield to a desired lane change).  This has produced a new model of driver behavior, which has been implemented through the Aimsun API (2,3) and is now being used experimentally in research (4).  This model is able to provide a sufficiently realistic representation of lane changing that it can be used to simulate multi-lane highway driving, in contrast to the model that we used several years ago for our initial estimates of the effects that ACC and CACC were likely to have on highway capacity (5).  Using the NGSIM oversaturated flow model, we are simulating a freeway section with entrances and exits, operating at a high traffic density at a speed limit of 120 km/h.  The traffic entering upstream and at the onramps has been defined with stochastic time gaps representing realistic vehicle following behavior.  The base case for verification involves no ACC or CACC vehicles, but only vehicles driven by drivers characterized by the NGSIM model.  Using this model, we ramp up the traffic volume, gradually adding more vehicles until the flow breaks down.  Once that breakdown point is established, we back off to a slightly lower volume and then simulate the freeway section for an extended time to verify that the traffic could remain in steady state, and compare the traffic volume with documented examples of freeway capacity.   REPRESENTING ACC AND CACC PERFORMANCE  The ACC and CACC vehicle-following dynamics are modeled using simple models that represent the essential aspects of their behavior, without attempting to represent the finest details of vehicle dynamics.  However, these models have to be high enough in fidelity to capture the marginal string stability of the autonomous ACC in contrast to the cooperative ACC.  The most important aspect of this modeling work is the use of the vehicle-following gap distributions that the drivers actually selected in our field test (6), as reproduced in Figure 1.   Figure 1 Driver selection of time-gap settings for ACC and CACC while engaged in vehicle following.  3 The simulation model has been defined to represent four categories of vehicles, with different attributes:  (a)  Manual vehicle - driven manually by a driver, with car following behavior represented by the NGSIM oversaturated flow model  (b)  Adaptive cruise control (ACC) -  car following is determined based on a simple first-order control law representing the behavior of a typical ACC system, with relatively slow, gentle responses to changes by the car ahead.  (c) Here I am! (HIA) - driven manually just like the Manual vehicle, but it is equipped with a DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) radio that frequently broadcasts a ¡°here I am¡± message giving its location and speed.  If it is being followed by a CACC vehicle, that following vehicle can use CACC.  (d) Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) - if it is following an HIA vehicle or another CACC vehicle, it can use its CACC car-following capability.  If it is following a manual vehicle or an ACC vehicle, it acts like another ACC vehicle.  The CACC car-following capability includes a faster response to changes by the car ahead and permits following at significantly shorter time gaps.   TRAFFIC EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL  If we begin with conventional autonomous adaptive cruise control, and assume that drivers choose the same car following gaps as they did in our field test (5,6), the variations of highway lane capacity with respect to ACC market penetration are remarkably mild, as shown in Figure 2.   Figure 2. Highway Lane Capacity (Vehicles/Hour) as a Function of Changes in ACC Market Penetration  4 These variations are so small (less than 3% from minimum to maximum values) that they are within modeling variability and can be considered negligible.  This means that we should expect ACC to have no appreciable effect on highway capacity.   TRAFFIC EFFECTS OF COOPERATIVE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL  By contrast, if we simply consider the effects of introducing CACC vehicles into the vehicle population as an alternative to manually driven vehicles, the effects on highway capacity become quite dramatic at the higher market penetrations, as shown in Figure 3.   Figure 3.  Highway Lane Capacity (Vehicles/Hour) as a Function of Changes in CACC Market Penetration Relative to Manually Driven Vehicles   The trend of highway capacity with respect to market penetration is quadratic because the shorter CACC time gaps can only be achieved when the vehicle in front of the CACC vehicle is also equipped for CACC operations.  So, although it is possible to nearly double highway capacity when all vehicles use CACC, even at a 50% market penetration the increase in capacity is still quite modest (17%) compared to all-manual driving.  A market penetration of more than 80% CACC vehicles is needed to reach a lane capacity of 3000 vehicles per hour.   EFFECTS OF ADDING ¡°HERE I AM¡± VEHICLES  One of the concepts that has been developed to enhance the effectiveness of cooperative vehicle systems at low market penetrations is the addition of a simple aftermarket communication device to vehicles that are already in operation.  This inexpensive device would contain a GPS antenna and receiver to provide positioning, speed and heading data, combined with a DSRC radio to broadcast this ¡°Here I am¡± status information to all nearby vehicles so that their cooperative systems can be made aware of its presence.  Such  5 a vehicle could act as the leader for a CACC vehicle, enabling it to use its CACC capability, even while the ¡°Here I am¡± vehicle may not be equipped with any advanced driver warning or control assistance systems.    Figure 4.  Highway Lane Capacity (Vehicles/Hour) as a Function of Changes in CACC Market Penetration Relative to ¡°Here I Am¡± Vehicles   If all the vehicles on the road were equipped one way or the other (with either the CACC system or an HIA system), the trends in highway lane capacity with respect to CACC market penetration would be as shown in Figure 4.  Here, the addition of the HIA system to all of the non-CACC vehicles converts the quadratic relationship seen in Figure 3 to a more nearly linear one, because the CACC vehicles can now use their CACC capabilities all the time, regardless of what kind of vehicle is driving in front of them.  For example, at the 50% market penetration of CACC, the capacity increase relative to all-manual driving is 35%, and the capacity of 3000 vehicles per lane per hour can be reached at a CACC market penetration between 60% and 70%.   EFFECTS OF MIXES OF VEHICLE CLASSES  Reality is more complicated than the simple two-dimensional cases that have been presented in Figures 2-4, since we have four possible classes of vehicles that could be sharing the roadways.  The effects of variations in market penetration among three of these classes can be shown simultaneously in one three-dimensional plot.  These effects are shown first for different combinations of manually driven, ACC and CACC vehicles in Figure 5.  This figure is analogous to a plot that was shown in our original estimate of the capacity effects of ACC and CACC market penetrations in a simulation study dating back  6 to 2002 (5).  The capacity estimates in Figure 5 are slightly lower than the earlier estimates, which were based on an a priori  assumption that the CACC vehicles would all be driven at a time gap of 0.5 s before we had the benefit of the field test results.  In fact, the mean time gap for CACC driving in our field test was about 0.7 s, which still allows for a significant capacity increase, as shown in Figure 5.  Not surprisingly, the capacity increases are directly associated with the growth in CACC market penetration, and are essentially independent of ACC market penetration.   Figure 5 Prediction of Lane Capacity Effects of ACC and CACC Driven at Time Gaps Chosen by Drivers in Field Test (With the remaining vehicles manually driven)    Figure 6  Prediction of Lane Capacity Effects of HIA and CACC Driven at Time Gaps Chosen by Drivers in Field Test (With the remaining vehicles manually driven)  7  Figure 6 shows the analogous results when the ACC vehicles are replaced by HIA vehicles, which are able to serve as cooperative lead vehicles for the CACC vehicles.  In this case, there is a modest increase in the lane capacity as the HIA vehicle market penetration increases.  These results also show that the HIA vehicles can make more of a contribution to increasing highway capacity when they are combined with CACC vehicles than the conventional ACC vehicles can.   CONCLUSIONS  This is the first study to show the effects that ACC and CACC are likely to have on highway capacity based on real-world observations of the time gap settings that drivers have selected when using these systems for their rush-hour commute driving.  Combining these realistic distributions of time gap values with a state-of-the-art model of car following behavior for the drivers of manually driven vehicles gives significant weight to these findings compared to some previously reported results that have been based on unrealistically simplified models.    The results of the simulations reported here show that conventional autonomous ACC has virtually no effect on highway capacity because the time gaps that drivers select with that system are so similar to the gaps that they select when driving manually.  In contrast, with the CACC system the drivers choose gaps that are on average less than half the gaps they choose with ACC, resulting in a large potential capacity increase (to 4000 vehicles per hour per lane if all vehicles use CACC).  This is because the CACC vehicles can respond more quickly and accurately to any changes of motion by the leading vehicle, which significantly increases drivers' confidence in the system for shorter time gap following.  High market penetrations of CACC are needed to achieve the large capacity increases because of the need for a CACC vehicle to follow a cooperating vehicle in order to achieve a reduced time gap.  When all other vehicles are unequipped, the capacity increase profile is quadratic with respect to CACC market penetration.  If the other vehicles are equipped with simple aftermarket communication devices that can broadcast their location and speed (so-called ¡°Here I am¡± devices), the capacity increase is closer to linear with respect to CACC market penetration, and it becomes possible to achieve moderate capacity increases at moderate market penetration levels.

The study of lanemarker detection using computer vision has a long history. Botts¡¯dot marker detection is moredifficult than that for white lines because small, sparse, low contrast regions are mixed in withroad-texture noise. We propose a Botts¡¯dot marker detection method in which we have in-troduced a Botts¡¯dot feature filter and a cumulative Hough transform. The Botts¡¯dot featurefilter was designed to better locate Botts¡¯dot candidates within a noisy road texture image,both in direct sunlight and in shadow, by calculating the brightness within a triplicate ROI(region of interest) in which Botts¡¯dot shapes are adjusted, and by using results of a learnedbrightness-characteristic model. A cumulative Hough transform was designed to robustly es-timate lane boundary lines formed by Botts¡¯dots, using sparse and noisy feature points andextending an ordinary Hough transform for use in spatiotemporal filtering. Our experimentalresults have confirmed that the method offers robust detection. They also indicate that the cu-mulative Hough transform achieves good spatiotemporal interpolation of sparse image features,significantly improving robustness in the detection and tracking of lane boundaries formed byBotts¡¯dot markers. In particular, a false detection rate with our method was roughly 1/5 thatwith the reference method using an ordinary Hough transform (at a false rejection rate level of0.2).1INTRODUCTIONVision-based lane detection is a key technology in such intelligent transportation system appli-cations as driver safety navigation and autonomous driving. While road-lane marking is mostcommonly done with white or yellow lines, Botts¡¯dots are also used for the same purpose.They are ordinarily round or square in shape and are roughly 10 cm in diameter and 1-2 cm inheight. Currently, they are mainly used in the southwest of the U.S., and throughout California.Much previous research has been conducted on lane marker detection (6). One commonly usedtechnique for white lines detects edge feature points using image gradients and uses line fittingvia a Hough transform, such as that used by Duda et al. (2); (see McDonald (7)). Botts¡¯dotmarker detection is more difficult than white-line detection because small, sparse, low contrastregions are mixed in with noise, such as blob regions (areas which look like Botts¡¯dots), inroad textures and in other vehicles. Studies on Botts¡¯dot detection are far fewer than those onwhitelinedetection, andmuchworkremainstobedoneonthestatisticalevaluationofdetectionperformance and on the development of practical Botts¡¯dot detection systems. Gehrig et al. (3)and McCall et al. (5) detect Botts¡¯dots by using frame-by-frame detected Botts¡¯dot features,geometrical road models, and a Kalman filter for tracking (4). This approach works well whennoise features are not detected in video images at a high rate relative to the rate for Botts¡¯dots.In real road images, noise features can be as common as frame-by-frame Botts¡¯dot features.This can degrade the accuracy of lane tracking, and greater robustness with respect to noise isneeded.We propose a new Botts¡¯dot marker detection method that employs feature extraction usinga Botts¡¯dot feature filter, in addition to robust lane boundary estimation using a cumulativeHough transform. Our Botts¡¯dot feature filter detects positions of Botts¡¯dots in a camera im-age via a triplicate ROI (region of interest) filter kernel. Botts¡¯dot shapes are adjusted and abrightness-characteristic model is learned for greater robustness with respect to differences ofcontrast conditions caused by shadows and by variations in road type. Our cumulative Houghtransform is an extension from an ordinary Hough transform for use in spatiotemporal filter-ing. It enables as to robustly estimate lane boundary lines formed by Botts¡¯dots having sparse,noisy feature points. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the detection performanceof our method, using an originally produced dataset for highways in the western U.S. Resultsconfirm that the method offers robust detection performance. They also indicate that the cu-mulative Hough transform performs well in the spatiotemporal interpolation of sparse imagefeatures, significantly improving robustness in Botts¡¯dot marker detection.BOTTS¡¯DOTS DETECTION METHODBotts¡¯dots are placed sparsely along lane boundaries, as shown in Fig. 1 (for more detailson Botts¡¯dot patterns on California highways, please refer to (1)A20A ). Botts¡¯dots can bedifficult to detect in camera images because of their smallness, simple shapes, sparseness, andlow contrast against noisy road-plane textures.OVERVIEW OF METHODFig. 2 gives an overview of our method. We use a Botts¡¯dot feature filter to extract features,and then we detect feature points as candidates for Botts¡¯dot positions. Candidates for laneboundary positions are estimated using a cumulative Hough transform that functions as a spa-tiotemporal filter to extract lane boundary positions on the basis of feature points from which2Figure 1: Sample California road-plane image containing Botts¡¯dot markers.it has removed noise data. We use verification and tracking with a Kalman filter (4) in post-processing to remove outliers from among the candidates for lane boundary positions. At theend of the process, detected lane boundary positions are output, as shown at the right-bottom ofFig. 2. Details for each step in the process are described in subsections below.Feature extraction with Botts' dot feature filterLane position estimation with cumulative Hough transformInput Image (video)Verification and tracking with Kalman filterFeature PointsCandidates forLane Boundary PositionDetected Lane Boundary PositionsProcessing flow Data flow OutputFigure 2: Overview of Method.CAMERA / ROAD-PLANE MODELIn this subsection, we describe camera / road-plane modeling, which is conducted to reveal therelationship between the actual road plane and the camera image of it. For simplicity in ourmodeling, assume here that the road plane is ¡þat and that lane boundaries are straight lines.Camera/road-plane modeling is illustrated in Fig. 3. The positional relationship between cam-era and road plane is shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b). The coordinate system for the image planeis shown in Fig. 3(c). The road plane is defined as the Xw-Zw plane of a coordinate systemXw-Yw-Zw. An image plane is defined in terms of the horizontal and vertical pixel axes u andv, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The camera projection matrix P is represented in Eq.

The filter kernel consists of ¡°internal,¡±¡°external,¡±and ¡°blank¡±areas, as shown in Fig. 4(b), and its size is adjusted to suit the presumedBotts¡¯dotimagesizeateachpixelposition. Wehaveintroducedthelearningofbrightness-valuedeviationsintheBotts¡¯dotmarkersandintheroadplaneformorerobustfeaturedetectionunderlow contrast or shadowed conditions. For the learning, we first collected dataset of road planeimages that contained Botts¡¯dots makers on asphalt and concrete road planes, under both directsunlight and shadowed conditions. Next, we use Botts¡¯dot positions and other positions onroad planes in the dataset to plot both the mean value of gray-scale brightness for all pixels ininternal area AIn and the max value for all pixels in external area AEx (see Fig. 5(a)). Thesetwo values can be represented, respectively, as:y = Meanfvalue(p)g; p 2 AIn (9)x = Maxfvalue(p)g; p 2 AEx; (10)where p is the pixel position and value(p) is the brightness at p. Finally, a threshold curve isdetermined for use in distinguishing between Botts¡¯dot and other positions.Internal Area:     External Area:   Blank AreaFeature Points(a) Input image (b) Filter kernel (c) Extracted feature pointsFigure 4: Outline of Botts¡¯dot feature extraction.

Here, f(x) is thepoint along the y axis which corresponds to the point on the threshold curve for a given x value.Margin values in the detection area are thresholded, and local maxima are extracted as featurepoints. This method effectively extracts feature points as candidates for Botts¡¯dot positions, asis illustrated in Fig. 4(c).CUMULATIVE HOUGH TRANSFORMOrdinary Hough transforms are used for space filtering to remove outliers in datasets of pointsand to extract line segments from the points (2). In detecting white lines, ordinary Hough trans-forms are commonly used when there are sufficient feature points in frame-by-frame imagesfor such detection. In detecting Botts¡¯dots, however, feature points are generally very scarcein frame-by-frame images, even in the best case. In our lane boundary estimation method, weuse a cumulative Hough transform (CHT). It is an extension of an ordinary Hough transform,designed for use in spatiotemporal filtering; it enables us to robustly estimate lane boundarylines formed by Botts¡¯dots under sparse and noisy feature-point conditions.We define our voting feature space (the same as a Hough space (2)) as H(; ;t). andare parameters denoting, respectively, the lateral intercept and the direction of a line on a roadplane. t is the temporal frame index. A feature point (u;v) in the image plane is mapped to apoint (xw;zw) on the road plane using Eqs. (7) and (8). A line is then mapped in the = spaceso that the following equation will hold:= xw zw cot : (11)All feature points detected by the feature extraction process are mapped in the feature space H,andavotingvalueinH correspondingtoa(; )willdenotethelikelihoodof(; )beingalaneboundary (; ). In Botts¡¯dot detection, the smallness of the number of feature points detectedin an image will mean low peaks in the voting values in H, making it difficult to determinelikely candidates.6Next, let us consider the cumulative Hough transform we use to compensate for the sparsenessof feature points. It is executed using the following simple formula:S(; ;t) =T¡Æi=0wiH(; ;t i): (12)Here, S(; ;t) is the weighted summation of H in the frame series [t; ;t T], and wi is theweight of summation at t i. This functions to amplify the voting values from the Botts¡¯dotsand to reduce those from random noise, making it possible for lane boundary positions to beestimated with accuracy. If the weight series is denoted by (< 1), as in wi = wi 1 = i,Eq. (12) can be simplified asS(; ;t) = H(; ;t) + S(; ;t 1): (13)Eq. (13) can be executed with lower memory and processing costs than can Eq. (12) (see Fig.6).+¡Á¡Á¡ÁW¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þH(t)H(t-1)H(t-T)S(t)Cumulative feature spaceFrame-by-frame feature spaceCoefficient vectorWriteReadRead¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þBuffer(a)+ ¡ÁwS(t)S(t-1) ReadWriteBufferCumulative feature spaceFrame-by-frame feature spaceCoefficient valueH(t)(b)Figure 6: Outline of cumulative Hough transform.

Feature points detected in a frame-by frameinput image are shown in Fig. 7(a); no points were detected on the left side. Using these featurepoints, a voting feature space H is generated using an ordinary Hough transform (Fig. 7(b)).

(b)and (c) are voting feature spaces at t generated, respectively, by ordinary and cumulativeHough transforms.each frame, lane-boundary-position candidates that have been extracted using the cumulativeHough transform are selected for each tracker by applying the following thresholding rule:j c ej th; j c ej th; (14)and searching for the maximum voting values for each tracker. In the thresholding rule, c, c,e, and e are, respectively, the lateral positions and directions of a candidate and of a tracker,as estimated using a Kalman filter. With the candidates selected for each tracker, we are ableto update, at each frame, the positions estimated with the Kalman filter. When a tracker has acandidate which has satisfied the thresholding rule for the past tth(= 30) frames, the trackerposition is output as a detected lane-boundary position. Otherwise, the position is rejected andthe corresponding lane-boundary position is not output. If no candidate satisfies the above rulefortth framesinarow, thecorrespondingtrackerisremovedandregeneratedatapositiondeter-mined on the basis of information regarding the other tracker positions, past detected positions,and lane width. If a tracker position is outside the range of 4000 4000[mm], it alsoremoved and regenerated.EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have conducted experiments to evaluate the detection performance of our method.DATASETWe collected dataset images for the experiments. They were captured with a forward-mountedvideocamera(30[fps])onavehicledrivingonhighwaysinthewesternU.S.Anoverviewofthecamera setup is shown in Fig. 8. Ground truths regarding lane boundary positions in individualimages were labeled on the basis of human observations. Dataset properties are listed Fig. 9.Thetotalnumberofframesinthedatasetwas7,200, thetotalnumberoflabeledlaneboundarieswas 12,426; in many cases there was one or two lane boundaries in a single frame. The dataset8consisted of 3 scenes that contained no lane changes and 3 other scenes that included a singlelane change each. A number of dataset input-image samples are shown in Fig. 10.Camera HeadMiniDV RecorderFigure 8: Camera setup.4,500 frames1,800 frames900 frames1,800 frames- without a lane change#17#18#2012,426Total Labeld lane marks2,700 frames900 frames900 frames900 frames- with a lane change#026#027#0287,200 framesTotal frames4,500 frames1,800 frames900 frames1,800 frames- without a lane change#17#18#2012,426Total Labeld lane marks2,700 frames900 frames900 frames900 frames- with a lane change#026#027#0287,200 framesTotal framesFigure 9: Dataset property.Figure 10: Samples of dataset.METHODOLOGYIf the difference in lateral position between a ground truth and a detected result was smallerthan 30 cm on the actual road plane, the result was classified as correct. Otherwise, the resultwas classified as a false detection. This threshold value was determined in view of the fact thatthe accuracy of positions with respect to ground truths is approximately 30[cm]. If there wasno detected position corresponding to a ground truth, the result was classified as a false reject.9The false detection rate (FDR) and false rejection rate (FRR) were calculated using the numberof false detections NFD, of false rejects NFR, and of labeled lane boundaries in the datasetNGT as FDR = NFD=NGT, FRR = NFR=NGT. An ROC curve, used to evaluate detectionperformance in the experiments, can be described by plotting FDR and FRR (miss rate) along,respectively, the horizontal and vertical axes.In the experiments, in order to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed method,we conducted detection experiments for two different method: (1) our proposed method and(2) a reference method which employed an ordinary Hough transform and for which featureextraction and tracking were the same as with the proposed method. Here, in Eq. (13) was7=8 for the proposed method (using a CHT), and = 0 for the reference method (using anOHT; i.e., an ordinary Hough transform).RESULTSThe results for the experiments are shown on the ROC curves (Fig. 11). As may be seen, at anFRR level of 0.2, the FDR with the proposed method was roughly 1/5 that with the referencemethod. This confirms that our cumulative Hough transform offers much more robust detectionandtrackingperformancesthandoesanordinaryHoughtransform.

As shownin Fig. 12, 4th row, 2nd column, detected boundary positions have drifted to the left of theirtrue positions. This is because rapid lateral movement intensified variables and depressed thepeaks of values in the voting space of the cumulative Hough transform. This resulted in outliersbeing among lane-position candidates, and tracking delay arose. In this case, however, results10Figure 12: Sample detection results. Colored lines on road images denote lane boundarypositions detected using our method.with the proposed method were still better than with the reference method. The above problemcan be alleviated by means of sensing the vehicle¡¯s egomotion, using such inertial sensors as agyro and a speed meter, and/or such external sensing systems as GPS and vision-based systems.CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKWe have introduced here a Botts¡¯dots marker detection method that uses a Botts¡¯dot featurefilter, as well as lane boundary estimation that uses a cumulative Hough transform. Experi-mental results have confirmed that our method offers robust detection performance. ROC curveresults indicate that the cumulative Hough transform achieved good spatiotemporal interpola-tion of sparse, noisy image features and significantly improved robustness in the detection oflane boundaries formed by Botts¡¯dot markers.In future work, we intend to conduct experiments with which to evaluate performance undermore challenging conditions, including those found on frequently obstructed urban thorough-fares and, with respect to lighting, those found in early morning, twilight, and night-time situ-ations. We also would like to improve our method so as to better adapt to rapid lane changes,lateral drifting, and sudden changes in vehicle direction, as well as to construct adaptive frame-works with which we could dynamically optimize the parameters in the cumulative Houghtransform and in the brightness characteristic model of the Botts¡¯dot filter.11REFERENCES(1) California Department of Transportation, ¡°Standard Plans,¡±State of California Departmentof Transportation Publications Distribution Unit 1900 Royal Oaks Drive Sacramento, Cali-fornia 95815-3800, 2006, May.(2) Duda, Richard O. and Hart, Peter E., ¡°Use of the Hough transformation to detect lines andcurves in pictures,¡±Commun.

The new system assists the driver by monitoring the blind spot during lane changes. In particular, this system distinguishes a d etection object from the background and reduces the possibility of false background detection, thereby reliably helping the driver visually detect other vehicles running alongside or appro aching from the side rear. Experimental results confirm that this system has practicable detection performance with a low false detection rate. The new system can be built into conventional all-around monitoring systems[2] at low cost.   KEYWORDS  Lane Change Assistance, Visual Assistance, Approaching Object Detection, Optical Flow, Low Cost   INTRODUCTION  Vehicle-mounted camera systems are rapidly becoming popular as a means of monitoring safety around the vehicle. The most widely known among these systems is a back guide monitor that provides the driver with a complete display of the back area using a camera mounted on the rear of the vehicle. Recent reduction in in-vehicle camera cost has made it possible to install additional cameras in the front and on the side of the vehicle[2]. These vehicle-mounted cameras are attracting attention for their visibility assist function and recognition support function that warns th e driver to check the conditions around the vehicle. When changing lanes, the driver must confirm safety in the side rear and side zones while steering the vehicle. Car ma kers sell various systems[3,4] that alleviate the burden on the driver in thes e situations. Thes e systems de tect vehicles h iding in the driver ¡¯s b lind spo t and vehicles  approaching from the side rear. However, these systems are expensive since they comprise special - 2 - purpose sensors and controller to monitor specific zones. In contrast to the approach taken by these commercially available systems, we have utilized an existing vehicle-mounted camera system and have developed on it a surrounding area monitoring system that assists driver¡¯s recognition during lane change maneuvers.   APPROACH  For LCDAS (Lane Change Decision Aid Systems; ISO 17387)[5], the blind spot of the driver to be monitored and the detection range for vehicles approaching from the side rear during la ne change maneuvers are specified. In particular, the LCDAS must monitor adjacent zones (Figure 1(a)) to detect vehicles running alongside the subject vehicle, and the side rear zones (Figure 1(b)) to detect vehicles approaching the subject vehicle from the side rear. An all-around monitoring system[2], which comprises four super-wide angle cameras mounted on the head, left and right sides, and rear of the vehicle, provides a field of view that can cover both of the above ranges in order to monitor the vehicles running alongside the subject vehicle and vehicles approaching the subject vehicle from the side rear, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). We have developed a surrounding area monitoring system that can b e built into an all-around monitoring system at low cost. The system configuration of the new system is shown in Figure 2(b).    Figure 1. LCDAS detection zones  - 3 -  Figure 2. System configuration   ASSIGNMENT  An optical flow-based moving object detection technology can be used to process images when detecting an approaching vehicle. This technology can detect an approaching vehicle by grouping the optical flows of the movement unlike a background. In practice, the following problems must be solved before th is technology can be used to detect either a veh icle running alon gside the subject vehicle in an adjacent zone or a vehicle approaching the subject vehicle from the side rear: (1) Detecting an object approaching from a long distance (detection of a  vehicle approaching the subject vehicle from the side rear) To ensure vehicle safety against possible collision with a vehicle approaching from the side rear, it is ne cessary to detect the approaching vehicle before i t comes close to the subject v ehicle. To d etect this veh icle by  detecting even the smallest movements, it is necessary to store p ast images a nd det ect the flow  of these i mages. A  conventional, general-purpose optical flow technology is impracticable for the above purpose since a large amount of memory would be required to fulfill the above image storage and image flow detection functions. (2) Distinguishing a vehicle running alongside from the background (detection of a vehicle running alongside the subject vehicle) A vehicle running al ongside the subject vehicle can be detected by detecting an object with a s mall optical fl ow. However, remote mountains and buildings also move slowly, causing conventional optical flow technology to erroneously detect a remote mountain or building as a vehicle running alongside the subject vehicle. (3) Frequent false detection due to optical flow tracking failure (common in (1) and (2) above) Since the subject vehicle is moving at high speed, conventional optical flow technology often erroneously tracks a different feature point and produces many false detection points in the background zone. ¢Ù ¢Ù Subject vehicle ¢Ú A djacent vehicle¢Û Vehicle approaching from side-rear ¢Ü FOV  of side camera ¢Ý FOV  of rear camera¢Ú ¢Û ¢Ý ¢Ü ¢Ü (a) Field of view (FOV) of each camera; The field of view of an all-around monitoring system covers both ranges for monitoring vehicles running alongside the subject vehicle and vehicles approaching the subject vehicle from the side rear.(b) System configuration example combining all-around monitoring system and approaching object detection; for low cost Approching object detection module Camera Navigation System Graphics SoC ECU - 4 - METHOD  We carried out a study on a low-cost system that can be built into a conventional all-around monitoring system. (1) Detecting an object approaching from a long distance To solve this problem, it is n ecessary to detect a slow-moving object at a far distance using t he least poss ible a mount of  memory. Our sol ution used the approaching object detection tec hnology[1] we had alr eady devel oped for blind corner m onitoring during stopping. This technology uses only a small amount of memory to quickly detect an object approaching from a long distance. For example, when tracking an object in 32 frames, the memory amount can be cut by approximately 92% from conventional technology, as shown in Figure 3.   Figure 3. The amount of memory and the number of frames for flow computation; our method keeps the constant amount  (2) Distinguishing a vehicle running alongside from the background  To detect a veh icle running along side the subject v ehicle in an adjacent z one, it i s necessary to detect both vehicles approaching and moving slowly away from the subject vehicle. Since the magnitude of the optical flow of a moving-away near background (vec3) is greater than that of a vehicle running alongside the subject vehicle (vec1), the vehicle can be distinguished from the near background based on the difference between the magnitudes of these optical flows (vec3 > vec1). However, when viewed from the subject vehicle, a remote background seems to move slowly in the opposite direction, exhibiting the same optical flow characteristics as a vehicle moving slowly away from the subject vehicle, as shown in Figure 4. Thus, the use of optical flow cha racteristics alone is ins ufficient to distingu ish th e backgrou nds fro m a vehicle running alongside the subject vehicle. As a solution to this problem, we have developed a method that provides a zone to separate adjac ent zones (Figure 1(a)) fro m th e b ackground zon e based on  t he camera mounting conditions (height, depression angle, pan a ngle, and roll angle). When the side cameras are mounted at a certain depression angle and at the same height as shown in Figure 5, the new technology can distinguish the adjacent vehicle to be detected from the background as unnecessary to be detected depending on their positions on the image screen. - 5 - As the camera h eight a nd depression angle  increase, the im age screen se parates th e adjacent vehicle and background more distinctly and t hereby enhances the distinguishing accuracy. Addition of the following conditi ons has made it possible to d etect a vehicle running  alongside the subject vehicle based on its optical flow: ¡þ Compute the detection zone in real space by projecting the zone on an image screen, and use this zone as the detection zone. ¡þ Compute the zon e containing both a remote background zone and adjacent zone, and exclude this zone from the detection zone. ¡þ Do not track the optical flow of moving objects outside the detection zone.   Figure 4. Motions of vehicle running alongside the subject vehicle and backgrounds on camera image screen   Figure 5. Distinguishing adjacent vehicles from the background  (3) Frequent false detection due to optical flow tracking failure Conventional technologies often make false detection of such backgrounds as white lines and walls, as shown in F igure 6. False detection is caused fro m false matching of very similar patterns near feature points such as white line jags and wall markings. Analysis of image flows a nd detection ob jects rev ealed that op tical f low has t he follo wing characteristics: ¡þ Short temporal continuity of optical flow ¡þ Unsteady direction of optical flow ¡þ Detected objects have characteristic size and aspect ratio. Different from problem (2), false detection could happen at any point in a detection zone. Therefore, setting a detection zone is ineffective for solving this problem. From the analysis results discussed above, we focused on the following points as criteria for determining if an object has been detected erroneously. - 6 - ¡þ Continuous optical flow-tracking time Only optical flows that have been tracked for a long time should be chosen as detection objects. As shown in Figure 7, detecting only objects whose optical flow was tracked 20 times or more was effective in removing 95% or more of false detection cases. However, increasing the number of tracking times delayed object detection. To minimize false detection using a small number of track ing times, we additionally introduced the fol lowing false detection criteria: ¡þ The randomness of optical flow direction As a simple ev aluation of the randomness, we calc ulate th e inn er product of two consecutive optical f lows of a feature poi nt. Chose only  optic al flo ws whose  inner  products fall within a certain range, i.e. 90 degree. ¡þ Deviation in the size of detected objects Notify detected objects whose size is larger than a pr edetermined value and an aspect ratio smaller than another predetermined value.

[Detecting a vehicle running alongside the subject vehicle] The object detection performance experiment for the newly developed system was carried out in a test course. Ordinary vehicles were k ept out of th e course to keep the system free from detecting these v ehicles. A subject vehicle equipped with the  side cam eras of  an all-around  monitoring sy stem and a t arget vehicle w ere driven in accordance w ith th e e xperimental conditions shown in Table 1. The target vehicle was driven alongside the subject vehicle in each experimental scene. The detection performance of the new system was evaluated using a total of 24 scenes. Evaluation results are shown in Table 2. We confirmed from this table that th e previously discussed method 2 was effective in detecting the existence of a vehicle in an adjacent zone in 20 out of a total of 24 scenes. However, in scenes where the target vehicle changed lanes, method 2 could not detect it because the  detection zone set up by  this method was extremely small, as shown in Figure 8. S uch false detection of vehicles can be eliminated by optimizing the area of the adjacent zone/background zone separation. To evaluate the false detection reduction performance of the new system, we prepared a subject vehicle mounted with the side cameras of an all-around monitoring system. The evaluation experiment was conducted under regular traffic conditions. The false detection frequency (percentage of the number of false detection frames in 7,000 evaluation frames) is shown in Table 3. An example of a false detection image is shown in Figure 9. Use of methods 2 and 3 reduced the false detection rate significantly to approximately 1% from approximately 60% with conventional systems.  Table 1.

A subject vehicle mounted with the side cameras of an all-around monitoring system and a target vehicle were driven according to the experimental conditions shown in Table 4. The subject and target vehicles were driven for a total of 19 scenes. Figure 10 shows the detection distances for vehicles approaching the subject vehicle from the side rear in all experimental scenes. This figure confirmed that the previously discussed method 1 was effective in detecting vehicles at a distance of 15 m or more in all scenes. This figure also shows that the new system could not detect motorcycles as effectively as cars. This is because the image size of a motorcycle is smaller than a car, making it difficult to pick out the feature points of th e motorcycle. Since an all-around monitoring system uses wide-ang le cameras (with a horizontal angle of view of 190¡ã), picking out the feature points of a motorcycle becomes extremely difficult as its distance from the subject vehicle increases. However, such a disadvantage can be overcome by using higher resolution cameras. Figure 10 also shows that the object detection performance was lower on a curved road than on a straight road. This is because on a curved  road, a detection object distant from the subject vehicle ran outside the side rear detection zone, as shown in Figure 11. The newly developed system has been designed to detect vehicles running on straight roads. However, the detection range can be modified in principle to cover vehicles running distant from the subject vehicle on a curved road, we will develop how to adapt our system to this situation in future. To evaluate the false detection reduction performance of the new system, we prepared a subject vehicle mounted with the side cameras of an all-around monitoring system. The evaluation experiment was conducted under regular traffic conditions. The false detection frequency (percentage of the number of false detection frames in 15,000 evaluation frames) is shown in Table 5. An example of a false detection image is shown in Figure 12. The introduction of method 3 significantly reduced the false detection rate (percentage of the number of frames containing one or more false detection cases in 15,000 evaluated frames) to approximately 10% from the previous approximately 80%. Five times of continuous optical flow tracking was used as evaluation criteria. Vehicle detection performance of the new system can be improved by reducing the number of continuous tracking times. There is a trade-off relationship between the vehicle detection performance and the increase in faulty detection frequency by tracking failure. Faulty detection can be further lessened by optimally setting the continuous optical flow tracking time in response to the targeted detection performance of the system.  Table 4.

We will continue to fu rther improve the object detection performance and redu ce the false detection of the new system toward practical use.   REFERENCES  1. M. Mizutani, T. Tsuruta and E.

The omnidirectional risk index is the function of potential risks of all vehicles that surround a driver's vehicle. We aimed to evaluate how well drivers could notice and manage hidden risks using this index. In this research, we evaluated risks on lane changing maneuvers using a driving simulator. Through analysis of the maneuvering data of lane changes, we could abstract two types of driver who showed characteristic lane change behaviors. In one type, the risks for following vehicles increased as the lane change process p receded. In t he o ther t ype, t he b ackward r isks showed almost no c hange. W e guessed that this difference was due to preparation for lane changes. The latter driver checked and estimated how much acceleration was needed not to increase risk. Also, we performed traffic simulation experiments. We developed mathematical models for two types of drivers using the omnidirectional index and compared effects of lane changes with these two manners. 2  It was shown that lane changes without care of backward risks would cause severe traffic congestion. It would be beneficial for all drivers to notify risks using the omnidirectional index and to make their driving behavior safer and smoother. We believe that these benefits could convince drivers that the omnidirectional index is useful and effective to support their daily driving life.  INTRODUCTION Although the number of fatal casualties in car accidents has been decreasing, car accidents still remain a crucial social problem in advanced nations. Even though a variety of safety equipment has been de veloped and implemented, it is still necessary for drivers to work intentionally to make their driving behavior safer. In order to support drivers who need to be trained, it would be effective to detect and inform inappropriate driving behaviors. In such detection or  i nformation s ystems, i t i s i mportant t o c onvince drivers th at th eir d riving behaviors are inappropriate from a fair poi nt of  vi ew. T herefore, w e a im t o de velop an objective method which can examine driving skills quantitatively. As is well-known, behind one car accident, dozens of near-accidents happen, and there must be thousands of risky driving b ehaviors. We believe t hat i t i s m ost effective for dr iving education a nd d riving assistant systems to analyze those risky behaviors and to utilize analyzed results.  Several safety metrics have been proposed to examine collision risks in the situation where drivers f ollow a  pr eceding ve hicle (MTC: Margin T o C ollision (1), P DCA: Potential Deceleration for Crash Avoidance (2)). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no practical method that can evaluate the degree of risk in a complicated driving situation like lane changing. In this report, we will propose the omnidirectional risk index that can analyze potential collision risks to all vehicles which surround a driver¡¯s vehicle. And we report analysis of lane changing maneuvers in a driving simulator applying the proposed method.   Furthermore, we examine the influence of lane change maneuvers on the surrounding traffic environment. We develop mathematical lane change models using results in driving simulator experiments. And we evaluate and compare effects of lane changes on traffic flow using a traffic simulator.   METHODOLOGIES OMNIDIRECTIONAL RISK INDEX Among a variety of proposed safety metrics, MTC and PDCA are methods to deal with the potential collision risks of drivers who follow a preceding vehicle. Potential collision means 3  that collisions do not happen actually but might occur in an emergent situation. Even though the driving situation is not obviously dangerous, careful drivers expect potential emergencies. On the contrary, careless drivers cannot foresee potential dangers, like the sudden stop of a preceding vehicle. Those kinds of careless and potentially dangerous driving behaviors can be elucidated using potential collision risks. We chose the potential risk concept to analyze risky driving behaviors.  In order to evaluate risks in complicated driving situations, like lane changing or merging, we need to know the potential risks of adjacent vehicles, which might be hazards in a lane change process. Therefore, we expanded the potential risk concept to all around (omnidirectional) vehicles and na med i t t he om nidirectional r isk i ndex. Figure 1 s hows a n e xample of  a situation in which the omnidirectional risk index is applicable.    Figure 1. An example in which the omnidirectional risk index could be applicable.  Because it monitored all risks around the vehicle, oversight or unawareness with regard to a risky s ituation c an be  detected b y t he om nidirectional r isk i ndex. W e be lieve t hat t he omnidirectional r isk in dex c ould be  a  pow erful t ool f or dr iver e ducation pr ograms or  development of driving support systems.  THE EVALUATION METHOD The omnidirectional risk index is a set of potential collision risks of all vehicles surrounding an obj ective ve hicle. T he pot ential c ollision r isk i s e valuated i n t he situation where an objective driver follows a preceding vehicle. As illustrated in figure 2, a n objective vehicle (vehicle 2) follows a preceding vehicle (vehicle 1) with inter-vehicle distance D12. And it is assumed that vehicle 1 suddenly brakes with deceleration a1. A driver in vehicle 2 is supposed to notice the sudden deceleration within a reaction time (Tr), and applies the brake to avoid a crash with deceleration a2.   The definition of potential collision risk is the margin of inter-vehicle distance (MTC) or deceleration t o a void c ollision ( PDCA) i n the case of  a h ypothetical s udden s top of  a  During Lane Changesuddenly brake! Accelerating!4  preceding vehicle. Among several definitions, we used the inter-vehicle distance at the time when both vehicles completely stopped. In the following text, we called the abovementioned inter-vehicle distance the margin distance for potential collision and evaluated it using the following equation 1.   Figure 2. A situation in which a potential collision risk was calculated.  ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ= ¡þ¡þ12 ¡þ¡þ¡þ2 ¡Á ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ¡þ12¡þ¡þ1¡þ¡þ¡þ22¡þ¡þ2   (equation 1)  DMD is the margin distance for potential collision; D12 is the inter-vehicle distance; Vi is the velocity of vehicle i; ai is the deceleration of vehicle i (positive ai means deceleration); Tr is the reaction time of the driver of an objective vehicle, the time between a preceding vehicle¡¯s braking and the objective driver¡¯s braking. All parameters are evaluated at the moment when vehicle 1 s uddenly brakes. In e quation 1, w e a ssumed t hat ac celeration of the following vehicle was zero during reaction time Tr to simplify analysis.   The o mnidirectional r isk in dex is  d efined a s a  s et o f a ll ma rgin d istances for pot ential collision. The characteristic feature of our proposed index is to take into account a potential crash from following vehicles. It also is calculated using equation 1. But in this case, vehicle 1 is an objective vehicle and vehicle 2 is a following vehicle. Literally, the calculated result means the margin d istance for pot ential collision of  a  f ollowing v ehicle. H owever, w e considered that careful drivers tended to pay attention to following vehicles. When the margin distance for potential rear collision was short, experienced drivers attempted to decrease risk in some ways. We assumed that such an effort to decrease risk would be reflected as a change of the margin distance for potential rear collision. According to the definition of the margin distance for potential collision, it is difficult for an objective driver to avoid a crash if there is a negative component(s) in the omnidirectional risk index. We assumed that a safe driver could manage a potential collision, and all components in the proposed index were positive.

Ltd. (3). In this driving simulator environment, a driver is totally surrounded by large (>52 inches) high definition LCDs and the simulator can provide an immersive driving experience. Also, the simulator generates highway traffic with numbers of automated cars running. In the experiments, the average speed of vehicles in the slower lane was set at 70km/h. In the faster lane, vehicles ran 80 km /h or 90km/h. Examinees (total 5, middle age males) were instructed to change their lane and take over the preceding vehicles. Therefore, the examinees needed to accelerate properly to penetrate into an adjacent gap.   We set two types of experiments: An ¡°easy type¡± (inter-vehicle distance was set to 30 m to 90 m) and a ¡°difficult type¡± (inter-vehicle distance was set to 30 m to 50 m). An examinee drove in a simulator for a total of 40 minutes (8 runs of 5 minutes driving each), and we collected 155 cases of lane change (average 31 lane changes for one examinee). We recorded vehicle maneuvering data (inter-vehicle distance, speed, acceleration, steering) and calculated and analyzed omnidirectional risk indices. In the analysis of the following sections, we set both a1 and a2 to 0.6 G which is the average deceleration of full braking of a usual vehicle (4). Also, we used 0.7 sec for Tr as the average reaction time for common drivers (2).  TRAFFIC SIMULATOR It is well-known that traffic congestion occurs when the volume of traffic flow exceeds the traffic capacity of a road. However, recent research on traffic engineering has elucidated that one risky driving behavior could cause traffic congestion (5). Traffic congestion is caused by a ¡°chain reaction¡± of brakes. One vehicle braking might cause braking of a following vehicle. In the case of a critical traffic flow, braking might rapidly generate a ¡°chain reaction¡± of brakes and finally it might cause traffic congestion. The traffic observation research reported that a characteristic lane change caused traffic congestion (5). But, besides the specific lane changes, the numbers o f lane changes taken place and the kinds of lane change did not  generate an y traffic congestion. Therefore, there must be some criteria for a lane change maneuver to be an origin of traffic congestion.   We considered that the omnidirectional index might give some clue to clarify these criteria. Through analysis of  c orrelation be tween t he o mnidirectional i ndex a nd t he m agnitude of  congestion, it might be possible to abstract characteristic features of ¡°bad-mannered¡± lane change. T herefore, w e at tempted p reliminary research t o ex amine the influence of  l ane changes on traffic flow. We used a traffic simulator which was developed by Fujitsu Labs. Ltd. 6  (3,6). At first, we made a driver model for a lane change on a traffic simulator by referring the reported research (7). And we adapted this by applying the analyzed results of lane change experiments on a driving simulator. In this adapted model, the margin distance for potential collision is calculated for a preceding and a following vehicle in the adjacent lane of an objective vehicle. The objective vehicle made a lane change when both margin distances were larger than a certain criterion. When at least one of both margin distances was smaller, it meant the adjacent lane was dangerous to enter. Therefore, the objective vehicle controlled its speed to change the margin distances to meet the criterion. We changed the criterion for lane change and compared effects of lane change on congestion by monitoring the average speed of the lane into which an objective vehicle merged.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF LANE CHANGE MANUEVERS  We analyzed lane change maneuvers which were obtained in driving simulator experiments. Especially, we focused on the preparation step of a lane change, since drivers judged the plausibility of lane change within this early period. We selected three characteristic timings in our analysis as described in figure 3: (1) drivers turned their blinkers on, (2) drivers started steering, (3) vehicles reached the center line.    Figure 3. The timing when the omnidirectional index was evaluated. Vehicle A: A preceding vehicle, Vehicle B: A following vehicle, both in adjacent lane.  At first, we compared the omnidirectional indices which were obtained in the ¡°easy¡± and ¡°difficult¡± types of lane change condition. Figure 4 shows the evaluated risk indices for lane change from the slower to the faster lane. In both figure 4 (1) and 4 (2), the left side and right side three columns show the risk index for a preceding and a following vehicle, respectively. The notation E1 through E5 represents the examinees in the experiments. We obtained 83 and 72 lane changes in ¡°easy¡± and ¡°difficult¡± lane change experiments, respectively. And, in both (1) Blinker on(2) Start steering (3) Between lanesVehicle A Vehicle B7  figures, the illustrated risk indices were the averaged values for over 10 to 20 m aneuvers. Therefore, we considered that tendencies which were found in these figures meant individual features for each driver.   As is clearly shown in the figure, no specific features were observed in the ¡°easy¡± lane change condition (figure 4 (1)). In this experiment, almost all drivers merged into long gaps (> 50 m), and dr ivers di d not  s how c omplicated m aneuvers. O n t he ot her h and, i n the ¡°difficult¡± condition, drivers n eeded to make effort to search for a n appropriate gap and had to be  cautious of controlling their speed to change their lane. Therefore, we would address the analysis of experimental results in the ¡°difficult¡± condition.   Figure 4. The omnidirectional index during lane change maneuver. Relation between an objective vehicle and vehicle A (B) was described in figure 3.  As shown in figure 4 (2), with the ¡°difficult¡± condition, there were specific time dependencies for the risk index. We could abstract four characteristic features as follows:   1. In the early preparation period of a lane change, the risk index for a preceding and a following vehicle were almost the same.   2. The risk index for a  following v ehicle gradually d ecreased i n almost all ex perimental results; the potential r isk of  r ear collision i ncreased. S ince t here w ere 10 t o 20 km /h differences between the slower and faster lanes, the risk would be increased in the case where a lane change from the slower to the faster lane occurs without enough acceleration.  3. Only examinee E4 kept the index of the rear vehicle nearly the same. And E4 showed the lowest r isk i ndex f or a pr eceding ve hicle. This means that e xaminee E 4 in tentionally (1) Easy type lane change (2) Difficult type lane change-10-505101520253035Blinker OnStart steeringOn the center lineBlinker OnStart steeringOn the center lineOmnidirectional Risk IndexE1 E2 E3 E4 E5-10-50510152025Blinker OnStart steeringOn the center lineBlinker OnStart steeringOn the center lineOmnidirectional Risk IndexE1 E2 E3 E4 E58  decreased the margin distance to a preceding vehicle and attempted to increase the backward margin distance to avoid increasing the potential rear risk.  4. At the time when the vehicle reached the center line, the index of two examinees (E3, E5) showed a negative value. According to the definition, it would be difficult for these two drivers to avoid a rear collision were the traffic condition to change unexpectedly. Especially, examinee E3 showed the largest margin distance to a preceding vehicle. This means E3 gave too much of a risk margin to a preceding vehicle and did not set enough of a margin distance to a following vehicle.  Throughout the analysis described above, we could find two types of drivers who showed different lane change maneuvers and they could be distinguished using the omnidirectional index. In one case, the risk index for following vehicles decreased and finally became a negative value. In the other case, drivers kept the risk index almost constant. We assumed that the former driver tended to underestimate or to ignore risks of a following vehicle and the latter could grasp the backward risk correctly.  EFFECTS OF LANE CHANGE ON TRAFFIC CONGESTION As was discussed in previous section, we could abstract two types of drivers: (1) one was cautious a bout v ehicles behind and ( 2) t he ot her i ntentionally i gnored or  did not  s ense backward risks. We expected that those two driving attitudes would show different effects for other v ehicles an d finally t hose e ffects m ight cause d ifferent t raffic f low. T herefore, w e attempted to compare the influence of these two types of drivers using a traffic simulator.   In the traffic simulator, vehicles automatically decided their behavior referring to a rule set. The rule set was called the driver model. We made driver models for the abovementioned two types of drivers. The difference was expressed by changing a t hreshold to initiate a l ane change. Automated vehicles checked the omnidirectional risk index and started a lane change when the index was larger than a certain threshold. Cautious drivers were expressed by a vehicle with a high threshold, i.e. they made a lane change in a situation where the backward risk was small. On the contrary, careless drivers had a low threshold. This means they made a lane change in a rather risky situation.   We calculated traffic flows with merging vehicles. On the expressway, vehicles ran at the rate of 1200 vehicles per hour, and their average speed was 80 km/h. Into this stream of vehicles, a slight amount of vehicles merged at a rate of 30 vehicles per hour. Cautious vehicles started a lane change when the margin distance for potential collision toward a following vehicle was a positive value. Contrarily, careless drivers performed lane changes even though the margin 9  distance was negative. Thus, some careless drivers started a lane change even though the risk index was negative.   Figure 5 shows the simulation results of an average speed of vehicles on the expressway. When a vehicle merged in safety criteria (blue line in figure 5), traffic flow kept its speed. But when there were risky merges (red line in figure 5), the average speed decreased and finally traffic c ongestion oc curred. T his r esult c ould b e i nterpreted as f ollows: C areless m erges forced following vehicles to brake unnecessarily and accumulation of unnecessary braking caused traffic congestion. While the margin distance was negative, there was no obvi ous danger. Thus, some drivers assumed that they could change their lane in the condition where there w as a  p otential r isk, i .e. the margin di stance w as ne gative. But, t hose ki nds of  maneuvers forced following drivers to decelerate unnecessarily. And even though it was a slight amount of deceleration, it could generate a ¡°chain reaction¡± of deceleration and finally there might be traffic congestion.   Although this was a hypothetical result, we believe that the cautious lane change described here was beneficial not only to the safety of the driver (i.e. avoiding collisions) but also to the smooth mobility of all drivers (i.e. decreasing traffic congestion).  Figure 5. Effect of lane changes to traffic flow.  We compared the difference of the average speed of traffic flow when the lane change condition was changed.   CONCLUSION We proposed the concept of the omnidirectional risk index to evaluate hidden risky situations in a traffic environment. In order to clarify its usefulness, we analyzed driving behaviors using the proposed index. We especially focused on the analysis of lane changes, because this 0204060801000 20 40 60average speed (km/h)time (min)positivenegative10  index was suitable to assess risks in a complicated driving situation.  In experiments with a driving simulator, we collected and analyzed maneuvering data of lane changes. And we abstracted two types of drivers who showed specific lane changes. In one case, the risk index for a following vehicle decreased as a l ane change sequence proceeded and finally the risk index showed a negative value. In the other case, the index for a rear vehicle did not decrease. We guessed that this difference was due to the preparation of a lane change. The latter driver checked and estimated how much acceleration was needed to keep the index positive.   Then, w e pe rformed t raffic s imulation e xperiments. U sing the omnidirectional i ndex, w e modeled two types of drivers, who were cautious about and insensible to backward risk, respectively, and compared the effects of lane changes to traffic flows. It was shown that lane changes without care with regard to backward risks might cause severe traffic congestion.  Of course, the criteria used in the traffic simulation were different from real world traffic conditions, but from this result we would like to insist that it would be beneficial for all drivers to notify risks using the omnidirectional index and to make driving behaviors safer and smoother. Through the help of the omnidirectional index, drivers can avoid not only collisions but also traffic congestion. We believe that these benefits could convince drivers that the omnidirectional index is useful and effective for supporting their daily driving life.

The assistance system is designed to be able to accelerate automatically in longitudinal direction and provide a beep sound to cue the initiation timing of steering maneuver by considering the human reaction time. The feasibility of the proposed assistance system is tested on a driving simulator (DS) of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT). The experimental scenarios are indicated in details and the obtained results are statistically analyzed from the individual and overall aspects of the conducted experiments.   Key words : Driver assistance systems, Lane change maneuver, Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems, Driving Simulator, Reference driver model  INTRODUCTION Statistical data of traffic accidents shows that 90% of traffic accidents are caused by human errors (1). Especially, lane change maneuver which requires high driver cognitive workload and skills always causes severe traffic accidents because of misjudgment of initiation timing and magnitude of acceleration and steering. To prevent traffic accidents and realize safer driving environments, human error as the primary factor of accidents must be rejected from  - 2 - the closed-loop driver-vehicle system, thus driver assistance systems are one of promising solutions. Study on driver assistance system can potentially improve the safety, traffic capacity and efficiency of transportation systems. To pursue these benefits, such a field has become one of the most interesting research directions for decades (2)(3). As a result, technologies concerning lane keeping and lane change also achieved significant progresses. From surrounding recognition (4)(5) to driver behaviour modeling (6-9), many important research directions are being driven to a more mature stage. Furthermore, a number of algorithms which intend to improve the safety aspect by increasing the cornering performance and lane tracking stability based on AFS and DYC have also been proposed (10)(11).   This paper proposes a driver assistance system in highway lane change maneuver which optimizes the driver behaviour by providing the desired accelerator pedal displacement and the steering maneuver initiation timing. The proposed driver assistance system is designed based on the theoretical derivation of a reference driver model which recognizes the surroundings by taking into account the gap and velocity of surrounding vehicles that can be potentially acquired by on-board LIDAR/radar/image sensors in next-generation intelligent vehicles. In the second section, the theoretical explanation of the reference driver model in lane change maneuver is described. The construction of the proposed assistance system and the experimental procedures are described in the third section. Finally, experimental results are described to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed driver assistance system.  DETERMINATION OF REFERENCE DRIVER MODEL Referring to the previous studies by the authors' research group, the related experiments were carried out by using TUAT (Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) driving simulator (DS, Fig.1)  (12). The experimental driving situation is shown in Fig.2. The host vehicle is travelling with velocity V1=70 km/h. In the adjacent lane, a platoon of vehicles is travelling at a velocity of V2 with a time-gap between vehicles Thw  of 2 seconds. The driver of the host vehicle was instructed to change into the gap behind the marker vehicle. Five drivers were selected, each of them carried out the experiments in three conditions with V2 equals to 80 km/h, 90 km/h and 100 km/h. For every experimental condition, 5 times of experiments were executed.     Fig.1 TUAT Driving Simulator (DS )   Fig.2 Experimental driving situation   - 3 - EXTRACTION OF LANE CHANGE FEATURES The acceleration results of V2=100 km/h are shown in Fig.3. The curves are processed to avoid high frequency noises. Comparing with results of other experimental conditions which are not shown here, longitudinal acceleration (ax) is always carried out as a trapezoidal shape with different amplitude. The lateral acceleration ( ay) keeps almost the same shape and amplitude regardless the variation of V2. In Fig.4, axmax  and aymax  indicate the amplitude of longitudinal and lateral accelerations respectively. Tx and Ty indicate the time duration of the two accelerations. jx indicates the jerk (first derivative) of ax, which has the same absolute value in both acceleration and deceleration processes. t is the time that is required by longitudinal acceleration to reach  axmax . to, one of the most important parameters, represents the time difference between the starting point of longitudinal and lateral accelerations. Here, the two accelerations are presumed to converge to zero at the same time as the driver finishes the lane change maneuver. To fulfill the requirements of lane change maneuver, acceleration procedure should be able to compensate the velocity difference between the original lane and the destination lane. In other words, integration of (the area that is covered by) the longitudinal acceleration should be equal to the velocity difference, that is, 12max )( ¡þ¡þ=¡þ¡þ VtTa xx         (1) Where, the velocity difference is %V2-1=V 2'V1, and the time duration for reaching axmax  is defined as  xxjjat max=           (2) and  yox TtT +=          (3) Substituting tj and Tx into Eq.(1) and rearranging the format, the following equation is obtained 0)( 12max2max =¡þ¡þ+¡þ+¡þ ¡þVjajTta xxxyox       (4) Solving Eq.(4) and choosing the root which keeps the desired shape of longitudinal acceleration, we get the following expression [ ]24)()()(122max¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ+=VjjTtjTttaxxyoxyoox      (5)  Lateral acceleration is set as a sinusoidal wave, therefore  )2sin()( max tTatyyy ¡þ=¦Ð&&         (6)   Where y&& indicates the lateral acceleration. Integrating Eq.(6) with boundary conditions: 0)0( =y& , 0)0( =y and WTy y =)( , aymax  can be represented as   - 4 - 2max2yyTWa¡þ=¦Ð         (7) in which, W indicates the lateral displacement of lane change maneuver. In this paper, W corresponds to the width of the track.    SYNTHESIS OF REFERENCE DRIVER MODEL  To fulfill the demands of lane change maneuver, constraints about safety and host vehicle performance should be understood in the first place. Moreover, an optimized lane change procedure which can mimic human driver behavior best should be chosen as the reference.   Lane change constraints The pictorial diagram of common driving circumstance in highway is shown in Fig.5. The host vehicle is surrounded by car C1, C2 and C3. C1 and C2 are platoon cars travel at speed V2. C3 is preceding car, travels at the same speed as host vehicle V1, V2>V1. Initial distances between C1, C2, C3 and the host vehicle are represented by X1, X2 and X3. The host vehicle is tending to make a lane change from position A to position B. Position C is the point where vehicle trajectory crosses the lane marker. Longitudinal distances between A and B (C) are represented as L1 (L2). After geometrical approximation (13), L1 and  L 2 can be expressed as: )(21)()( 1211 oyoyo tTVtTVtL +¡þ¡þ++¡þ¡Ö ¡þ          (8) )2(2)()2()(21)(2maxmax12yoxoxyooxcoTtjtaTttaTVtL +¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ+¡þ¡Ö         (9). In Eq.(9), Tc is the time duration for the host vehicle to travel to the lane marker, Tc = to + Ty/2.  Fig.3 Acceleration  data from experiments (V 2=100 km/h)  Fig.4 General profiles of longitudinal and lateral acceleration  Fig.5 Common highway traffic situation   - 5 - The lane change maneuver is highly influenced by surrounding cars. A safely accomplished lane change maneuver has to fulfill the following three constraints: (Fig.6) Constraint 1 : after lane change maneuver, the host vehicle should keep a safe inter-vehicle distance with the forward vehicle C1.  Constraint 2 : after lane change maneuver, the host vehicle should keep a safe inter-vehicle distance with the rearward vehicle C2.  Constraint 3 : when the host vehicle reaches the lane marker, it should keep a safe inter-vehicle distance with the preceding vehicle in the original lane C3. After defining the margins ( m1, m2, m3) which are used for keeping a minimum safe distance between the host vehicle and the surrounding cars, three equations which express the above mentioned constraints can be obtained as follows  11211 mLTVXD x ¡þ¡þ¡þ+=           (10) 21222 mLTVXD x +¡þ¡þ+=          (11) 32133 mLTVXD c ¡þ¡þ¡þ+=          (12) In Eq.(10)-(12), the origin of a vehicle-fixed coordinate system is located on center of gravity (CG) of the host vehicle. D1, D2, D3 are the predicted distances between the host and the surrounding cars (certain values of margins are included) when the host vehicle finishes lane change maneuver or is right crossing the lane marker. To avoid collision, D1 and D3 must be kept positive, D2 must remain negative. Substituting Eq.(3), Eq.(8) and Eq.(9) into Eq.(10)-(12), we can get the following expressions 1121211 )(21)()( mtTVTtVXtD oyyoo ¡þ+¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ¡þ+= ¡þ¡þ       (13) 2121222 )(21)()( mtTVTtVXtD oyyoo ++¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ¡þ+= ¡þ¡þ      (14) 32maxmax33 )2(2)()2()(21)( mTtjtaTttaXtDyoxoxyooxo ¡þ+¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ+¡þ¡þ=      (15)               Fig.6 Surrounding cars constraints   - 6 - Besides the above mentioned constraints caused by surrounding cars, limitations caused by the performance of the host vehicle also play important roles and should be taken into consideration. In this paper, the friction circle limitation is restricted by setting the maximum longitudinal acceleration and the profile of vehicle accelerating procedure (trapezoidal) is formulated by predefining the longitudinal acceleration curve. In Eq.(5), the term inside the square root has to be positive to keep axmax  a real number. Furthermore, ensuring the following condition [ ] 122 4)( ¡þ¡þ¡þ>¡þ+ VjjTt xxyo         (16) can also makes Tx>2t  that can shape ax as a trapezoid. (applying Eq.(1) and Eq.(2) into Eq.(16)). Therefore, after adding two more limitations, the constraints that ensure a safe lane change maneuver can be summarized as shown in Table.1 where alim  is the upper limitation of the longitudinal acceleration. The above restrictions are all inequalities concerning to. In this case, a range of to which satisfies all the constraints exists. In other words, to which is inside this range is that which can make the host vehicle change the lane safely.   Fig.7 shows how the constraint functions vary with the change of to. By solving the five constraint inequations, five roots can be found and named as x1¡­x5 corresponding to Constr.1~Constr.5 in Table 1. One point should be noticed is that only when to is bigger than  x5, values of D3(to) and Axlim (to) are real. Based on the former mentioned restriction inequalities and their variation tendency, a range of to can be determined as maxmin ooo ttt <<          (17) in which ),min();,,max( 32max541min xxtxxxt oo == .   Because of predefinition of lateral acceleration properties, longitudinal acceleration is the function only related to to, see Eq.(5). As a result, a group of axmax  which can lead to a safe lane change maneuver can be calculated. However, only one axmax  can be carried out, the remaining issue is how to choose the most appropriate one from a number of candidates.  Table.1 Summary of constraints   Fig.7 Variation tendency of Constr.1~5 with the change of t o   - 7 - Selection of the optimized finishing point  Theoretically, all to inside the above mentioned range indicated in Eq. (17) could accomplish the lane change maneuver safely. However, human drivers are trying to finish such a maneuver at a safest position. According to the previous experiments, the desired finishing point can be decided as shown in Fig.8. thw is the symbol of time headway. The desired finishing point is located at the point D' where we leave 0.35 thw with the preceding car. Right before lane change maneuver starts, the initial position of the point D can be expressed as:  21 35.02VtlX hwcar ¡þ¡þ¡þ          (18) where lcar  refers to the length of the vehicle, definition of X1, see Fig.5. To make the host vehicle finishes at the desired position,  xTVL ¡þ= 23          (19) 2131 35.02VtlXLL hwcar ¡þ¡þ¡þ+=         (20) Substituting L1 and  L3 by Eq.(8) and Eq.(19) and rearranging the format, we can get the desired to which can be expressed as: yhwcardesiredo TVXVtlt ¡þ¡þ¡þ+= 12 27.0      (21) Fig.9 shows the relationship of to with the change of the relative distance between the platoon car C1 and the host vehicle. According to Eq.(17), only those to which are located inside the rhomboid fulfill the demands of the above mentioned constraints. Among those qualified  to, those which are on the curve todesired (Drela ) could simultaneously satisfy the requirements that finish the lane change maneuver at a desired position. To keep an appropriate value of to and simplify the selection procedure, a to threshold line is determined by simply adding 0.5 seconds to the curve tomin (Drela ). The first to point right after this line is chosen as the output value of to, see Fig.9, point tooutput. The logic flowchart of the reference driver model is shown in Fig.10.  LANE CHANGE ASSISTANCE SYSTEM STRUCTURE OF LANE CHANGE ASSISTANCE SYSTEM The driver assistance system is designed to be able to accelerate automatically in longitudinal direction and provide the steering guidance beep sound at an optimized timing determined by the reference driver model. The schematic diagram of the system is shown in Fig.11. ax* indicates the reference longitudinal acceleration. ay* indicates the reference lateral acceleration. Ph denotes the accelerator pedal displacement generated by the human driver. Pm denotes the accelerator pedal displacement generated by the reference model. P denotes the total accelerator pedal displacement which is an input signal into the DS vehicle motion  - 8 -   calculation module. ¦Äsw  denotes the steering wheel angle. V denotes the actual velocity of the vehicle. The assistance system starts activation by the driver via the turn indicator signal.   Longitudinally, since the reference model only determines the accelerations as the reference, to realize automatic longitudinal acceleration, a conversion from reference acceleration to vehicle control input - accelerator pedal displacement is necessary.  As it is difficult to convert the pedal displacement from the acceleration due to the nonlinearity between the current vehicle speed and the pedal displacement, the reference velocity (V*) which can be acquired by a simple integration of ax* is used as the input signal of the controllers. Based on the relationship between the vehicle velocity and the accelerator pedal position that has been identified by previous experiments, the feedforward controller (indicated by the block F/F in Fig.11) is determined with a linear function which can be expressed as: Pf(V*)=mV*' n          (22) In which m and  n are constants, Pf is the pedal displacement generated by the feedforward controller. The remained deviation is compensated by the feedback controller (indicated by the block F/B in Fig.11) which is determined with the PI controller.    Laterally, the magnitude of the steering wheel angle corresponding to the reference lateral acceleration will not be provided to drivers. However, to avoid the misunderstanding /  Fig.8 Desired finishing position extracted from human experiment  Fig.9 to versus relative distance between C1 and host (Drela)   Fig.10 Logic flowchart of the reference driver model  - 9 - misleading of the steering timing, a beep sound is generated according to the reference driver model. The beep sound contains three high-pitch beeps with the same time intervals (single beep duration = 0.2s with a duty ratio (ON/OFF) = 2/3). The first two beeps are given for driver preparation. Considering human reaction time to the beep sound, the last beep sound is set to activate at 1.2 seconds earlier than the start of the reference lateral acceleration model.     EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES The effectiveness of the proposed lane change driver assistance system is verified by using TUAT Driving Simulator. The traffic scenario is set as same as shown in Fig.2 with V1=70km/h, V2=100km/h, Thw =1.5s. Sixteen novice drivers are selected (within four years driving experience and no longer than 3000km of annual driving distance) and instructed to carry out experiments with and without the proposed lane change assistance system. Every subject carried out 3 times of experiments for each situation. Before experiment starts, several times of pre-drive are executed to make sure that all the subjects are familiar with the driving simulator, and understand the meaning of the provided assistances.     DISCUSSIONS DISCUSSION OF RESULTS BY A DRIVER  The result of subject 16 is shown in Fig.12 for its significance of the driver behaviour optimization and maneuver safety improvement. Fig.13(a) shows the comparison of accelerations. All experimental results from the case of without assistance and with assistance conditions are plotted. From the right graph, the automatic pedal is able to provide acceptable longitudinal acceleration by comparing the experimental outputs to the reference model signal. Though the magnitudes and time duration of lateral acceleration do not match the reference signal well since they mainly depend on the driving characteristics of different subjects, the start timings show good consistency because of the guidance by the beep sound. By comparing with the left graph, the fact that the longitudinal and lateral accelerations become unified with smaller dispersion and smoother maneuver can be observed which means the  Fig.11 Schematic block diagram of driver assistance system application  - 10 - assistance system is effective and the driver behaviour is improved since better repeatability of difficult lane change task is obtained.  To express the collision risk with surrounding vehicles, Fig.12(b) shows the situation of inversed time to collision ( Ttc'1: relative distance/relative speed) and time gap ( Tg: relative distance/velocity) between the host and surrounding vehicle C1, C2 (see Fig.5) during lane change. The data is recorded after the host reaches the central lane marker. The concept of risk feeling (RF) is introduced in this graph (14). The RF is defined as: gtc TTRF¦Â¦Á+=            (23) In which ¦Á and ¦Â are arbitrary constants (here, ¦Á = 1, ¦Â = 5). By applying the driver assistance system, the variance ranges become much smaller; moreover, the value of RF is regulated at a smaller value. These evidences show that the situational risk potential during lane change maneuver can be controlled and the driving safety in lane change maneuver is enhanced. Focusing on the risk potential relevant to the vehicle C2, it was found that the maneuver by the assisted driver does not disturb the traffic flow in the right lane, compared with the case of the driver without the assistance system.   To have better understanding, the comparison of travel situation time history between the experiments with (red) and without (green) driver assistance system is shown in Fig.12(c). Several representative time stamps ( a~g ) are chosen and marked on the graph. The time instants that the host vehicle reaches the lane marker of the two experiments are shifted to the same time instant. (time instant t = 0 in Fig.12(a)&(c)).    a.  The host vehicle with the assistance system (red) begins to accelerate when it has a distance (CG to CG) of 11.35 meters in front of C1 with initial speed 18.88 m/s.  b.  The host vehicle without the assistance system (green) begins to accelerate when it has a distance of 3.38 meters behind C1 with initial speed 18.55 m/s. c.  Both of the red and the green cars reach the central lane marker with speed 20.73 m/s and 26.04 m/s respectively. d.  Green reaches its maximum RF with C2. The speed is 26.81m/s and relative distance with C2 is 9.06m. Meanwhile, the red is still smoothly accelerating. e.  The red finishes lane change (no more obvious adjustments on velocity and relative distance) and stays stable at speed around 27.81m/s and relative distance with C1 20.34 m. After eliminating the influence of vehicle length, the finishing time gap with C1 takes a portion of 0.368 of the whole gap between C1 and C2. (In the design section, this portion is set as 0.35, see Fig.8). The green is accelerating with a big acceleration to avoid potential collision with C2.     f.  The green reaches its maximum RF with C1 because of the over accelerating and a hard brake is carried out to avoid potential collision with C1.   - 11 - g.  The green finishes lane change with speed 29.76m/s and relative distance with C1 20.27m. (still does not reach the desired velocity V2= 100km/h = 27.77m/s).      DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM ALL DRIVERS  Based on discussions made in Fig.12 (b) and (c), the RF can represent the collision risk potential with surrounding vehicles. Therefore, the maximum RF with C1 and C2 during lane change maneuver is recorded to be a key factor of driving safety assessment. Moreover, the subjects were asked to grade the driving difficulty of lane change maneuver with and without the proposed assistance system right after their experiments. The difficulty is divided into 9 levels from very easy to very hard corresponding with grades 1 to 9.  Fig.13 shows the maximum RF with C1 and C2 of all 16 subjects. The tendency is to be smaller and more unified. Fig.14 shows the result of driving difficulty evaluation. Friedman test is also conducted to confirm the significance level of both RF and driving difficulty data. From table.2, all three groups of data show significant difference. Since the experimental conditions are the same, the difference is caused by the proposed driver assistance system. Therefore, by applying the driver assistance system, the potential of situational risk with surrounding vehicle C1 & C2 during lane change is reduced among all drivers so that the safety is increased; the driving task of such lane change maneuver in a narrow gap becomes easier from the aspect of drivers' own feeling.    Fig. 12  Results exhibition of subject16   - 12 -   CONCLUSIONS  This paper described the design of driver assistance systems for difficult lane change maneuver in highway, e.g. conducting a lane change into a narrow gap of platoons in the adjacent lane. The effectiveness of the proposed driver assistance system was verified by experiments using Driving Simulator. The major conclusions to be drawn from the study are as follows: 1.  The reference driver model perceives the surrounding cars' information (relative distances and velocities) to determine the lane change initiation timing and the magnitude and the time duration of the reference accelerations with arbitrary traffic circumstances. 2.  Based on the reference driver model, the driver assistance system provides automatic longitudinal acceleration and guidance of steering maneuver initiation timing in order to accomplish a highway lane change maneuver. 3.  Among all novice drivers in the experiments, the driver assistance system is effective in assisting a lane change maneuver as good repeatability of driver behavior in such difficult lane change maneuver can be observed and collision risk potential relevant to the surrounding vehicles is reduced. All novice drivers give positive comments to the proposed system as it makes them feel easier to accomplish the difficult lane change maneuver.     In future, the proposed driver assistance system may be applicable to the next generation of the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. The system may recognize the surroundings by a wide-far-range radar or a LIDAR at front and back and give an automatic acceleration in order to follow a new target vehicle in the higher-speed lane when the driver demand is given.

-1-  EVALUATION OF RURAL SAFETY INNOVATION PROGRAM ITS GRANTS ¨C PRELIMINARY RESULTS  Alan Pate Principal Research Scientist, Battelle 505 King Avenue Columbus, OH 43201 +1-614-424-7611, patea@battelle.org Co-authors:  Bennett Pierce, Battelle; Theodore Smith, Noblis   ABSTRACT  The Rural Safety Inno vation Program (RS IP) is one  of several k ey program s under the U.S. DOT¡¯s Rural Safety Initiative.  In 2 008, twelve RSIP grants were awarded to state and county DOTs across the coun try t o dep loy ITS technologies in rural area s of t heir jurisdictions in an at tempt to improve safety in t hese areas.  Per the requirements of the grants, recipients agreed to p articipate in an independent evaluation of their deployments.  This ev aluation involves determining the effectiveness of the sp ecific technologies b eing deployed, conducting a qualitative assessment of the deployment experience of the grantees to facilitate a ¡°lessons learned¡± discussion, and assessing the specific impact of the deployed ITS components in improving safety.  Stakeholder interviews, focus grou p discussions, traveler intercept surveys, field data collection of vehicle speed data, and review of maintenance logs are some of the methods being used to ga ther evaluation data.  This  presentation will summarize the lessons learned from each of th e projects and discuss the suitability of the projects for deployment elsewhere in the future.  BACKGROUND  The Rural Safety Inno vation Program (RS IP) is one  of several k ey program s under the U.S. DOT¡¯s Rural Safety Initiative.   Overall, the goal of the initiative is to improve safety on rural roads, resulting in a decrease in the loss of lives and injuries.  The RSIP is of strategic importance to the U.S. DOT and other stakeholders, including the traveling public, because it provides a platform for understanding ¡°what works and w hat doesn¡¯t¡± in rural saf ety.  In  2008, twelve RSIP grants were awarded to state and county DOTs across the country  to deploy ITS technologies in rural areas of t heir jurisdictions.  Per th e requirements of the grants, recipients agreed to participate in an independent evaluation of their deployments.  Many ITS technologies deployed under the RSIP have previously been deployed and, in some cases, evaluated.  The RS IP evaluation is unique, however, in th at it provides a consistent basis for evaluation that will help the U.S. DOT answer questions regarding the applicability and limitations of these technologies relative to each o ther and provide guidance for larger widespread deployment.  This evaluation involves determining th e effectiv eness of the specific technologies being deployed, conducting a qualitative assessment of the deployment experience of the gr antees to f acilitate a ¡°lessons learn ed¡± d iscussion, and assessing th e specific impact of the deployed ITS components in improving safety.   -2-  OVERVIEW OF THE RSIP ITS GRANT PROJECTS AND EVALUATION DESIGN  Recipients of the RS IP ITS  grants were th e Arizona, Cali fornia, Colorado (2 gra nts), El Dorado County (C A), Illi nois, Iowa, Kansas, King County (WA ), Minnesot a, South Carolina, and Wisconsin DOTs (1).  Th ese twelve RSIP projects cover a broad range of  operational areas under the Rural Safety Initiative Focus Area of ¡°Smarter Roads¡± including, speed management and enforcement, situational alerts for changing environmental conditions, intersection collision avoidance, truck tip-over warnings, and enhan ced road markings and signage.  Similarly, many different ITS technologies are being utilized across the individual projects to acco mplish t he project -specific objectives, including:  speed sen sing rad ar, dynamic message si gns, v ehicle detection systems, RWIS,  cl osed-caption TV, radio messages, enhanced signs and signals, and in-road lighting/warning systems.  The size of the grants (including the 20% local match) ranged from $50,000 to $2,0 75,175.  Th e original deployment schedules called for all systems to be operational by February 2010; however, various issues encountered in some of the projects delayed their deployment until 2011.  The overall focus of this evaluation was slightly different from a typical evaluation of field ITS deployments.  In  particular, the evaluation of these twelve projects was broader than a traditional ITS evaluation and included:  ¡þ An assessment of specific technological components of the projects; ¡þ Application of prior findi ngs to current d ata for all of th e deployments to estimate outcomes of interest (e.g., crash rates, incidents, reductions in speed, etc.) for the entire RSIP program defined by the projects; and ¡þ An a ssessment o f the deployment e xperience a nd suitability fo r wi despread deployment.  Because ITS deployments are dynamic and occasionally what is proposed can be different from what is actuall y de ployed, one  ad ditional function of th e evaluation was to document any changes and the reasons why the deployment differed from the original design.  EVALUATION METHODS  A variety of methods were used to gather data to assess each of the RSIP ITS projects.  These methods included stakeholder interviews with the respective DOT safety and maintenance personnel, loca l law enforce ment and EMS personnel, a nd local g overnment officials; intercept surve ys o f trave lers; focu s groups w ith local reside nts; f ield data co llection of vehicle speed data; and review of maintenance logs.  Prior to undertaking the data collection efforts, pl anning webin ars were hel d with ea ch indi vidual project team to decide on the appropriate hypotheses and the test cases needed to address those hypotheses.  In all cases, the project team s w ere helpful in the planning process and in establishing contacts with th e necessary local stakeholders.  Depending on the sp ecific project,  data collection efforts we re s cheduled around t he time periods when the most travelers were likely to pass through the area where the ITS technologies were deployed.  The i ndividual DOTs performed the n ecessary field d ata co llections ( e.g., collection of speed data), and then transferred the data to the evaluation team for analysis.  The -3-  evaluation team conducted the stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions, and intercept surveys.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS  Due to various implementation delays that occurred for many of the projects, much of the evaluation has been pus hed into late su mmer and fall of 2 011.  Available results as of July 2011 are summarized below, along with descriptions of each project.  Additional results will be included in the final presentation.  ARIZONA  The Arizon a DO T projec t w as to develop, d eploy, and o perate a sy stem to detect low- visibility conditions and alert travelers and response personnel to the conditions.  The system will be deployed along I-10, in the Safford District of Arizona, a rural district southeast of Phoenix.  The impetus behind this project is the high rate of crashes and fatalities during low- visibility conditions in the rural Safford District.  The area experienced 37 crashes during low-visibility conditions between 2002 and 2007.  The system will consist of environ mental sensors to detect those c onditions most favorable for low visibility  situat ions, and a nu mber of alert mechanisms to advise drivers of the conditions.  The alert mechanisms will include static warning signs w ith remote-activated beacons, highw ay advisory  radi o, a nd d ynamic message signs.  An Internet-accessible ¡®dashboard¡¯ display  w ill all ow A rizona D OT, A rizona Department o f Public Safety, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff to m onitor the current readings of weather stations and views from cameras.  Because of various in ternal issues, Arizona DOT was unable to get started on it s grant until early 2011.  As a result, deployment was delayed and is now projected for early fall of 2011.  Data loggers installed with the system will be used to gather data to evaluate how the system performs.  In addition, interviews with Arizona DOT staff and other stakeholders will occur in October 2011 to discuss lessons learned from the project.  CALIFORNIA  The California DOT project is to research, design, develop, deploy, and operate an augmented Speed Enforce ment (aS E) syste m in an active work zone i n Ca lifornia.  The  system is intended to influence drivers, work zon e personnel, and law enforce ment personnel in the following ways: ¡þ Drivers ¨C the system will alert drivers that they are exceeding posted speeds in the work zone in an attempt to reduce speeds; ¡þ Work zone personnel ¨C the system will alert workers in the work z one to speeding vehicles in an attempt to provide advance warning; and ¡þ Law enforcement personnel ¨C the system will alert law enforcement personnel to the speeding vehicles to assist them in enforcing the speed limits.  The i mpetus beh ind t his project is  t he high rate of cr ashes and f atalities in and around  construction and work zones in California (and nationwide).  In California, there have been -4-  more than 21,000 crashes in work zones between 2005 and 2010 ¨C and roughly 250 fatalities in that time period.   The system will consist of: ¡þ Speed camera system capturing speeding vehicle identification information;  ¡þ Wireless communications to a Dynamic Message Sign (DMS), law enforcement patrol vehicle, and workers in the work zone; ¡þ DMS display  (with licen se plate number and speed) to in form drivers that t heir vehicles are exceeding the speed limit; ¡þ Cones with lights that illuminate as speeding vehicles pass through the zone; ¡þ Vibrating notification devices to be  worn by workers to receiv e alerts of speedin g vehicles; and ¡þ Information d isplay systems to be used by law enforcement perso nnel (in their vehicles) at the work zone site to receive notices of speeding vehicles.  Because of contracting issues with its partners (Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University and both th e P artners fo r Advan ced Transit and H ighways and th e Transportation Sustainability Research Center at  Un iversity o f Cali fornia, Berkeley), California DOT was u nable to make progress on its grant until early 2011.  In addition to  postponing work on the design and  implementation of the system, the delay resulted in the completion of construction at the work zone site that originally was intended to be used  during t he pr oject.  Efforts are  ongoing to identify a new site t hat meets the proje ct requirements.  It is unclear when deployment will occur for this project.  COLORADO ¨C US 50  The first Colorado DOT project was to install a curve warning system along US 50 roughly 10 miles east of Salida.  This portion of US 50 is a crowded rural corridor that has a particular series of compound curves that have historically seen a number of accidents.  During the last 10 years, there have been 38 a ccidents at this particular set of curves,  with 30% of thes e accidents involving trucks.  Typically, the accidents with trucks are a result of the truck driver overdriving the curves.  On average, there is a truck rollover event once every 1 to 2 months.  Having a truck rollover event is a significant event both in terms of the expenses and direct impact of the incident, but also the indirect impact of the road closure on the traveling public.  The nearest, simplest detour is roughly 150 miles away from the location of the compound curves, representing significant traveler time and cost.  The US 50 project includes two speed-actuated blank-out signs that display ¡°Slow Down¡± on the bottom half of the signs.  ¡°Tight curves¡± is continuously displayed on the top half of the signs (i.e., this message is not speed-actuated).  These signs became operational in December of 2009.  Speed is identified through radar and the signs are activated if the trigger threshold, currently set to 40 mph, is reached.   The innovative aspect of this project is the development of a stand-alone ITS system that is not dependent upon a fiber backbone for management and operation, but more importantly, due to the rural location of t his site (la ck of p hone and power), one of the signs must be operated with solar power.  Low power LED blank-out signs with separate battery packs and solar arrays to power the  blank-out signs and rad ar devices were used for this project.  Vehicle speed data were collected as part of a ¡°with and without¡± study design in May 2011.  Two weeks of data were collected while th e signs were turned on, and then an additional -5-  week of data were collected after the signs were turned off temporarily.  Tubes were used to collect the speed d ata.  D ata analysis to determine if there are any signific ant speed differences between the two scenarios are currently underway.  Interviews with Colorado DOT staff and other stakeholders concerning lessons learned from this project are scheduled to occur in late September 2011.  COLORADO ¨C WOLF CREEK PASS  The second Colorado DOT project was to install electronic warning signs and in-road LED  lighting at the Wolf Creek Pass Snow Shed on US 160 in Mineral County.  This snow shed is located near the top of Wolf Creek Pass and shields snow slides from the Alberta avalanche path from reaching the highway.  The highway configuration in the snow shed is three travel lanes ¨C one eastbound and two westbound lanes.  Because of the curvature of the road, it is not possible to see all the way through  the sn ow shed.  US 160 is heavily  used by ski travelers, tourists, recreational vehicles, and trucks transporting freight, and it serves as a primary east/west link for southern Colorado.  The highway to the west of the snow  shed is a long, downhill straigh t-away, which then curves rather sharply just prior to the snow shed.  Eastbound traffic tends to app roach the snow shed at  high rates of speed, regardless of the 35 mph posted speed limit and existin g electronic speed warning device that Colorado DOT previously installed in an effort to reduce approach speeds to the snow shed.  Eleven crashes were recorded in the snow shed between January of 2000 and December of 2004, resulting in six injuries and one fatality.  The fatality involved a head-on cross-over crash between a motorcycle and a recreational vehicle inside the snow shed.  Typical accidents involve vehicles crossing over the centerline of the roadway and either hitting oncoming vehicles or the snow shed wall.  One component of this project includes two speed-actuated blank-out signs on the face of the snow shed (one in each  direction) that flash a ¡°Slow Down¡± message when a radar device detects that a vehicle is going more than 35 mph as it appr oaches the snow shed.  Also, th e top half of the signs display a ¡°Tight Curve¡± message at all times.  A second component of the project was to install in-road LED lighting along the centerline and between the two uphill lanes of the roadway.  Yellow lights were used al ong the center line, and white lights were used between the uphill lanes.  The uniqueness of this project is that Colorado DOT used this lighting system to delineate a centerline, no-passing zone within the snow shed where lighting conditions are less than desirable and snow removal operations tend to obliterate conventional stripe d elineation.  This pro duct has previou sly been us ed to delin eate l ane lines  and  shoulders, but it has not been used to delineate opposing travel lanes.  Vehicle speed data were collected as part of a ¡°with and without¡± study design in February 2011.  Over the four-week data collection period, one week of data were collected for each of the four combinations of si gns and LED lights being tur ned on and off.  Data recording capabilities of the blank-out signs were used to collect the speed data.  Data analysis to determine if there are any significant spe ed differences between the various scenarios are currently underway.  Intercept interviews were conducted with skiers at the Wolf Creek Ski Lodge and travelers stopping by the U.S. Forest Service continental divide display at the top of Wolf Creek Pass in M arch 2011 and  July  2011, respectively.  Interv iewees wer e administered a v erbal -6-  questionnaire regarding their observations and experiences driving through the snow  shed since the ITS techno logies were deployed.  Initial review of the data indicates that most travelers view the deployment favorably; however, formal analyses of the interview data are ongoing.  Interviews with Color ado DO T st aff concern ing lessons learne d from this pr oject are scheduled to occur in late September 2011.  EL DORADO COUNTY (CA)  The E l Dorado County DOT proj ect was to install v ehicle-actuated D MSs near th e intersection of US 50 and Stil l Meadows Road.  In-road d etectors at the intersection will detect waiting vehicles and then actuate the DMSs, which are visible to both westbound and eastbound traffic on US 50.  Messages w ill be illuminated, warning travelers on US 50 to cross-street traffic in an attempt to slow the traffic down and alert drivers to the risk of a crash.  The intersection of US 50 and Still Meadows Roads has a history of a higher crash rate than the state average (22 crashes occurring over a 5-year period).  The statewide average collision rate for inter sections similar to this intersection is 0.22 cras hes per million vehicles.  In the years 2002 to 2007, the average crash rate for this intersection was 0.44 ¨C essentially double the statewide average collision rate.  The majority of crashes are broadside crashes involving vehicles entering US 50 from Still Meadows Road.  A long-ter m solution identified was an undercrossing; however, the ITS solution was identified as a near-term solution.  Teleconferences with El Dorado C ounty DOT staff concerning lesson s learn ed from this project were conducted in May 2011.  An online survey of local residents is und erway to gauge their impressions of any safety improvements realized by the deployment.  ILLINOIS  The Illinois DOT project was to install curve warning and intersection warning signs with vehicle-actuated LED lights at two locations along Farmingdale Road in Sangamon County.  The impetus for the signs was a fatal crash that occurred in December 2004 at a sharp curve on Farmingdale Road near Bornke Road and Old Salem Road.  While investigating the crash, Illinois DOT¡¯s Bureau of Safety Engineering and the Division of Highway Safety, along with the Sangamon County traffic engineer, determined that this road segment poses significant safety concerns because, after a fairly long straightaway, it enters a downgrade just before a sharp S-curve.  Especially at night, drivers of speeding vehicles may not see the curve in time, resulting in a  r un-off-the-road crash.  Thi s situation is what occurr ed (alc ohol was a  contributing factor as well) during the December 2004 crash (a second similar crash occurred just after Illinois was awarded its RSIP grant).  The crash investigators hypothesized that if drivers were alerted to the curve by  warning li ghts t hat were ac tivated as their vehicles approached, then they would be m ore likely slow dow n and traverse the curve in a safe manner.  During the investigation, the Sang amon County engineers indicated that there was another location further south on Farmingdale Road that had seen numerous accidents and might benefit from similar warning signs.  Farmingdale Road intersects Old Jacksonville Road, which carries vehicles travelling at higher speeds.  Accidents have occurred when the slower--7-  moving F armingdale Road traffic attempts to  cross or turn onto Old Ja cksonville Ro ad.  Warning lig hts on stop signs (Far mingdale Ro ad) and inte rsection warning signs (Old Jacksonville Road) that are triggered by vehicles waiting on Farmingdale Road to enter the intersection were determined t o be a good  way  t o focus drivers¡¯ att ention onto this intersection.  Installation of all of the signs was completed in October 2009.  Vehicle speed data were co llected as part of  a ¡°with and without¡± study design in November/December 2010.  One week of data we re collected while the signs were put  in a ¡°constant flash¡± state (Illinois DOT was not comfortable completely turning off the si gns), and then an additional week of data w ere collected after the signs  were set  back to their intended dynamic-actuation state.  HI-STAR data collection devices were used to collect the speed data.  Data analysis to determine if there are any significant speed differences between the two scenarios are currently underway.  Interviews with Illinois DOT and Sanga mon County staff con cerning lessons learned from this project and a focus group with local residents to gather their opinions of the project were conducted in December 2010.  The local residents have viewed the location with an S-curve to be a major safety issue for many years because of the high rate of speed of many drivers and the visibility issues caused by a vertical drop in the road and in tersecting roads at the points of the curve.  They believe that the deployment has helped reduce speeds in the area.  The state and county  staff also b elieve that the project has i mproved safety at th e project locations.  IOWA  The Iowa DOT project is to develop a web-based version of its Traffic and Criminal Software (TraCS), which is utilize d by  la w enforcem ent agencies to i mprove th e a ccuracy and completeness of crash and incident data.  The expectation is that it will be easier for rural law enforcement agen cies t o use a web-based v ersion of TraCS (TraCSWeb) be cause of t he reduced need for local IT st aff to manage individual instances of the software.  In addition, the quality of crash data received by the DOTs will vastly improve, thus will be more useful to traffic engineers and accident investigators.  Iowa DOT initially deve loped Tr aCS appro ximately 15 y ears a go, with th e intention of creating a comprehensive PC-based reporting system to expedite data capture for driver- and vehicle-related police reports.  Beg inning 10 y ears ago, the software was shared with other states interested in using it.  TraCS was designed as a ¡°fat client¡± program, which requires the software to be installed on every laptop being used (i.e., in every police cruiser).  Small law enforcement agencies have had difficulties using the software because they typically lack the technical staff t o maintain IT equipment and also face high  turnover rates that impact their ability to maintain trained users of th e software.  As a result, the decision was made to develop TraCSWeb for use by these smaller, typically rural, law enforcement agencies (the larger agencies also will have access to use TraCSWeb if they wish).  TraCSWeb will provide the functionality and u tility of TraCS, including ease of use for officers in the fi eld, while mitigating the need for technical staff.  At the same time that the TraCSWeb development was scheduled to begin, a new version of TraCS was released.  This new version was a completely new implementation (i.e., it was moved to a .NET programming architecture) and resulting issues related to fixing bugs in the software and assisting states with deploying the new software prevented the developers from -8-  focusing o n TraCS Web.  Instea d of rel easing TraCSWeb  in early 2010,  a s origi nally envisioned, the release has been postponed until the fall of 2011.  Beta testing has been occurring in June and July 2011 in preparation for the release.  Interviews with Iowa DOT staff and project stakeholders concerning lessons learned from this project are scheduled to occur in August and September 2011.  A survey of law enforcement officers that participated in the beta testing will occur in October 2011.  An analysis of the crash reports collected by the beta testers compared with crash reports collected by the same agencies prior to using TraCSWeb also will occur in October.  KANSAS  Kansas DOT partnered with the Prairie Band Potawatomi  (PBP) Nation for its RSIP project, which entailed installing various co mbinations o f dy namic message signs,  flashing beacon/queue systems, an RWIS, and a camera at three intersections of tribal roads and US 75 in Jackson County.  The objectives of this deployment were to alert drivers on US 75 to slow down, thus averting crashes at these dangerous locations; to warn tr avelers about hazardous road conditions or other traffic delays; and to provide better data about weather conditions so that more efficient road treatments can be made during the winter months.  An RWIS to measure bridge temperatures and other meteorological conditions was installed at the Tribal Road 150 interchange on US 75.  Data collected by the RWIS will be used by both Kansas DOT and the PBP  Nation to guide road treatment operations during the winter months.  A CCTV camera also was installed at the interchange and was situated such that both message signs (one so uth of the in terchange for SB tra ffic, and one north of the interchange for northbound traffic) are v isible from it.  I n addition to being used for sign verification, the cam era wil l b e utilized for incid ent management.  At t he other two intersections, a flashing beacon/queue system was installed to warn d rivers on U S 75 that vehicles ar e at the in tersection and may be turning onto US 75 or crossing it.   Sensors installed at the intersection will detect vehicles waiting at the intersection and then actuate the flashing beacons.  Wireless technology was used for communication purposes.  Installation of all of the components was completed in early 2011.  However, there have been continuing issues related to the proper performance of the beacons at Tribal Roads 158 and 162.  The main prob lem w ith the b eacons is th at t hey t ypically are in flash  mode continuously, instead of the planned dynamic triggering of the beacons based on the detection of vehicles at the intersections.  A variety of corrections have been attempted, including replacement of t he detection pucks and movement of t he wireless repeaters higher on t heir poles.  To date, none of the fixes have completely solved the problem.  As of August 4, 2011, testing indica ted t hat severe pow er fluctuations in the area  are d amaging the s ystem electronics.  Plans are underway to install UPSs, as well as  to  ch ange some of th e communication equipment in th e cabinet, w ith hopes that these fix es will finally solve the problems.  The changes are expected to be made by September 2011.  Interviews with Kansas DOT and PBP N ation staff concerning lessons learned from this project were c onducted in late  July 2011.   In additi on to addressing on the reo ccurring problems w ith the b eacons, th ese discussions focused o n the su ccess of the partn ership between Kansas DOT and the PBP N ation in the planni ng and i mplementation of this ITS deployment.  -9-  KING COUNTY (WA)  The King County DOT project is to deploy curve warning systems on two rural roadways in King County.  Both locations have high crash rates due to challenging horizontal and vertical curves.  The predominant collision types are r un-off-the-road, single vehicle, and crossing centerline collisions that appear to be associated with curvilinear alignments and steep grades.  For these reasons, the design was to have a warning and detection system as vehicles enter the onset of the curve and another sign immediately before the most critical portion of the curve, in addition to in-road lighting.  The ITS components of the project include speed detectors and driver feedback signs at both locations (Lake Holm Road and Novelty Hill Road).  Upstream signs warn about the curve, and a second sign is located just prior to the most challenging portion of the curve.  In  addition to the signs, in-vehicle pavement lighting at the centerline illuminates if a vehicle is exceeding the speed threshold, with the int ent to draw the drivers¡¯ attention to the warning signs.  Because the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control D evices does not allow horizontal lighting (running across the road), the in-pavement l ighting was placed par allel to th e direction of travel in the center line.  King County did not want the lights to flash, just to stay on solid when a vehicle is detected as speeding.  Teleconferences with King County DOT staff concerning lessons learned from this project were conducted in April 2011.  An online survey of local residents was conducted in May 2011 to gau ge their impressions of a ny safety improvements realized by the deployment.  More than 35 0 respondents co mpleted t he surve y, with m any of them in fav or of the deployment and many other opposed to the expenditure of money at these locations.  Formal analyses of the data are underway.  King County DOT conducted speed studies at these locations prior to and after the deployment as part of a ¡°before and after¡± study design.  One additional data collection of ¡°after¡± data will occur in Augu st 2011.  Resu lts of the d ata collections then will be analyzed to determine if any speed reductions are occurring.  MINNESOTA  The Minnesota DOT project includes dynamic curve warning systems at three rural curves.  The original plan was to deploy the systems in three different counties; however, just prior to implementation, one county decided not to participate in the project.  As a result, tw o curve warning systems are d eployed in Meeker County (CSAH 25 and CSAH 3) and one system was deployed in Mc Leod County (CSAH 7).  At eac h site, radar is used to detect vehicle speeds.  Warni ng messages ar e display ed to tra velers exceeding a threshold sp eed level (currently 55 mph).  The signs were turned on in May 2010.  Crashes on rural curves hav e been studied extensively for years in Minnesota.  Minnesota DOT has a ¡°Towards Zero Deat hs¡± progra m, a nd the co ncept of proactively p reventing crashes on rural curves has resulted from  the various research projects.  As a result, the Minnesota RSIP projec t is taking a pro active approach to rural l ow-volume r oad curve warning systems.  The intent is to deploy and test low-cost (ideally $10,000 or less) dynamic curve warning sy stems and evaluate the i mpacts and sustainab ility of such systems.  Therefore, the selected locations are not necessarily locations with extremely high crash rates.  Rather, th e concept is that rura l curve cras hes can occ ur at any curve, and therefore,  Minnesota DOT is exploring the fe asibility of one day having dynamic curve warning  -10-  systems on many rural curves thro ughout the state.  Th e criteria for s election of the three curves selected for this project were as follows:  ¡þ There n eeded to b e no  planned (o r recently completed) g eometric ch anges to th e curve; ¡þ The speed limit at the curve must be 50 mph or higher; ¡þ A proactive safety evaluation must have identified the curve as a priority, using factors such as: o The presence of a visual trap; o At least one crash in the past 5 years; o Radius of curvature less than 800 feet; o Proximity to other curves.  Teleconferences with Minnesota DOT, Meeker County, and McLeod County staff concerning lessons le arned fro m this projec t were c onducted i n Marc h 20 11.  Minnesota DOT¡¯s contractor for the project is conducting a separate study to determine any speed reductions at the curve locations.  Results from that study will be provided to the analysis team when they are completed.  SOUTH CAROLINA  The South Carolina DOT project was to install overhead variable message signs (VMSs) and variable speed limit (VSL) signs along a mountainous stretch of US 25 in Greenville County.  The county ranked second out of all counties in the state between 2002 and 2006 for having the highest number of rural road fatalities, with 251 fatalities reported during that timeframe.  The two-mile stretch of US 25 to be addressed by the project had been previously identified in 2008 by the South Carolina DOT as o ne that is prone t o a high nu mber of h ydroplaning accidents (85% of accidents between 2003 and 2007 were during wet weather conditions, and speed was a contributing factor in 62 of these 71 accidents).  This road segment consists of typical mountainous terrain combined with a six percent downhill grade and various roadway curvatures.  In this location, US 25 is a rural, primary, north-south four-lane divided highway with a concrete barrier in the median.  The median lacks drainage and can crumble at impact due to lack of rebar.  Snow and ice are not uncommon in this area.  The intent of the warning signs is to alert drivers to slow down, which will presumably result in av erting the h igh n umber of wet-weath er and run-off-the-road crashes in this area.  Originally, one sign of each type was to be installed near the top of the mountain (southbound traffic) and bottom of the mountain (northbound traffic), which would be actuated by a new rural weather information system (RWIS) installed in conjunction with the signs.  In addition, a camera w ould b e ins talled near each s ign, primarily for verific ation that the s igns ar e functioning correctly.  However, as the project n eared completion in Dece mber 2010, a Greenville County councilman objected to the northbound VMS because it would hinder views of the Smoky Mountains.  As a result, the northbound VMS sign was not installed.  The VSL signs will be installed on the uprights to the overhead VMS structures.  A standard RWIS station will be installed in the vicinity and will  actuate the signs using a seri es of contact closures.  Currently, precipitation will be the primary factor used in the algorithm that determines the sign disp lays; however, temperature could be incorporated into th e algorithm in the future.  The regional traffic management center in Greenville will monitor the signs -11-  using the two cameras that will be installed.  The cameras will transmit images in the five-frames-per-second range (i.e., not continuous video).  Additional problems with obtaining power and other construction difficulties have delayed final installation of the entire system.  Hopes are that the signs will be turned on in early fall  of 2011.  Initial vehicle speed data were col lected as part of a ¡°before and aft er¡± study  design i n September/October 20 10.  Four weeks of d ata w ere collecte d prior t o the signs being installed.  An additional four weeks of data will be collected in the fall of 2011 once the signs are fully functional.  Tubes were used to collect the speed data.  Data analysis to determine if there are any significant speed differences between the two scenarios will be conducted.  Interviews with South Carolina DOT staff concerning lessons learned from this project are expected to occur in late O ctober 2011.  Additionally, focus groups with local residents will be conducted at that time in order to gauge their opinions and acceptance of the deployment.  WISCONSIN  The Wisconsin DOT project was to install a Rural Intersection Collision Avoidance System (RICAS) at the intersection of US 53 and STH 77, just west of Minong, Wisconsin.  In this section of t he state, US 53 is a four- lane divided expressway with a wide median.  While some sections of the highway are fully access-controlled, most intersections (including the project location) are at-grade.  State Trunk Highway (STH) 77 is a two-lane highway running east-west through the Village of Minong.  This particular intersection was selected following a larger safety study performed on th e US 53 corridor between the cities of Rice Lake and Superior.  The study examined the crash history (from 1998 to 2004) of numerous intersections along the highway.  The results of the analysis determined that six of the int ersections exhibited a crash rate greater than expected for the given geometric and traffic volume conditions.  The intersection with STH 77 had the highest number of crashes during this period (3 0), the highest crash rate (1.9 per million entering vehicles), and the highest number of fatalities (5).  The other intersections had crash rates that ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 per million entering vehicles.  The RICAS uses emerging sensing, computation, and display technology to provide real-time warnings to drivers before the conditions that lead to a crash can develop.  Sensors are used on the mainline (in this case, US 53) to d etermine the position, speed, and lane of travel for vehicles approaching the intersection.  A utomotive rad ar is th e senso r of choice for this application be cause it is accura te, durable, reli able, available, relatively inexpens ive, and  works in all weather conditions.  Standard inductive loop detectors are installed on the minor road appro aches and  w ithin the median area t o s ense v ehicle pres ence.  If a v ehicle is detected, the system will activate the message board.  If no vehicle is sensed, the message board will remain inactive, thereby limiting distraction.  In total, four message boards were installed.  For each of the side street approaches, one is positioned for drivers at the first stop bar and the other is positioned for drivers at the median (internal) stop bar.    The en tire infrastructur e was fully  installed as of January 2010.  Electrical hook up was finished February 3, 2010.  Testing was completed by the end of March 2010, and the system was turned on in April 2010. -12-   Interviews with Wisconsin DOT, Washburn County, and Village of Minong staff concerning lessons learned fro m this project were conducted in August 2010.  The state and county stakeholders voiced favorable comments during these discussions about the deployment.  Intercept inte rviews were condu cted with skie rs at a convenience store l ocated near th e intersection of US 53  and S TH 77 in Octobe r 2010.  Man y travelers intercepted near the intersection believed th at the sig ns a re e ffective in  reducing a ccidents and c lose c alls; however, others believed that the signs are distracting or confusing.  Statistical analyses are underway to examine whether there are factors that might explain these differences (i.e., frequent travelers vs. visitors to the area).

The workshop provided an opportunity for ITS stakeholders to explore how advanced technology can be integrated with evaluation to support national and local ITS projects, and how evaluation can support sustainability and livability goals.  Addressing the state of the practice of ITS evaluation at this time is particularly important in view of the rapidly changing context in which ITS research and deployment occur.  For example, an increasingly urgent policy emphasis on deploying sustainable transportation solutions may influence the ITS investment decision-making by state and local government agencies.  Similarly, advances in technology may open the door for the development of new ITS applications.  This paper summarizes the workshop and presents participant observations and contributions.  Keywords: Intelligent Transportation Systems, ITS evaluation, evaluation workshop  INTRODUCTION  The United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) conducted a workshop on September 20, 2010 in Irvine, California for stakeholders to exchange information and explore ideas for advancing the practice of evaluation in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  Addressing ITS evaluation is important at the current time because of the changing context of ITS research and deployment.  Rapid developments in technology and the increasing urgency to deploy sustainable transportation solutions require a fresh look at evaluation tools and methods.  For evaluation to continue to add increased value to ITS research and deployments, it is necessary for the evaluation process to adapt to technological advances as well as develop meaningful measures of environmental outcomes.  Thus, the workshop provided an opportunity for the transportation community to explore ways in which evaluation can integrate advanced technology to support national and local ITS projects, and help meet sustainability and livability goals.  WORKSHOP PROCESS AND PARTICIPANTS  The workshop, entitled ¡°Emerging Needs and Opportunities in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Evaluation: Supporting New Directions in Research and Deployment,¡± was organized by the Joint Program Office (JPO) in the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) of the U.S. DOT.  The heart of the workshop was a set of breakout sessions in which participants provided ideas and input to specific questions in regards to evaluation.   An important aspect of the workshop was to involve a well-balanced cross-section of stakeholders.  Thus, the workshop team undertook activities to ensure that a diverse group would attend.  Final  -3- registration surpassed anticipated capacity, with sixty-four (64) participants, including private sector consultants, ITS system providers, local agency staff  (e.g., Metropolitan Planning Organizations), state DOT representatives, researchers, and representatives from Transport Canada, Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) and the Transportation Research Board (TRB).  BREAKOUT SESSIONS  The workshop held two main breakout sessions.  The theme for the morning session was ¡°Key Innovations and Opportunities in ITS Research and Deployment Evaluations.¡±  The focus questions were the following. ¡þ How do we make effective and innovative use of new technologies, new techniques, and new results? ¡þ How can we best and most creatively evaluate new JPO initiatives? ¡þ What innovations are you aware of that can be applied, or that have potential, for evaluation? ¡þ How do we effectively identify technology transfer opportunities?  The theme for the afternoon session was ¡°New Goals and Priorities in ITS Research and Deployment Evaluations¡± and consisted of the following two focus questions. ¡þ How do we obtain and best share meaningful evaluation techniques and results? ¡þ How do we measure and evaluate livability and environment-related goals?  WORKSHOP RESULTS: SYNTHESIS OF BREAKOUT DISCUSSIONS  Summaries of the stakeholder discussions are presented below for each of the six questions.  The headings for the discussions for each question represent themes expressed by the participants.  HOW DO WE MAKE EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW TECHNIQUES, AND NEW RESULTS?  In response to the above question, the participants in turn raised the question about the meaning of ¡°new,¡± noting that what is new to some may already be familiar to others, and that the need to adapt to new technology will vary across the traveling public as well as within the ITS transportation community.  Early adopters of technology will be further along the technology lifecycle (known as the ¡°S curve¡±) than others.  Even proven technologies can take long periods to reach wide scale deployment.  With that in mind, participants offered the following observations.  Data from mobile devices Mobile devices have saturated the market, providing opportunities for public agencies to use new sources of information.  Wyoming DOT (WYDOT) ¡°Enhanced Citizen-Assisted Reporting¡± (ECAR) is an example of an innovative approach to gathering data from mobile devices.  The program  -4- engages the aid of the public in the reporting of weather and road conditions.  ECAR volunteers report on conditions of the roads to WYDOT dispatchers, who use the information to update the road-condition database.  ECAR volunteers receive training from WYDOT on how and when to make their reports, and use an illustrated handbook supplied by WYDOT that shows pavement types and weather conditions.  Their reports supplement the information received from WYDOT maintenance personnel who report on conditions as they drove the road as part of their job (e.g., snow plow drivers).   Data from private vendors In the traditional way of gathering transportation data, public agencies collect data on a regular schedule at specific times and locations (point data).  Data are limited but well understood. However, agencies are now starting to use continuously collected data obtained and sold by private vendors.  The new approach to data gathering has led to cost savings (up to a seven times reduction), but also raises new questions and requirements.  Agencies must assess the reliability and accuracy of the data, understand the data format and interface with the vendor, and resolve legal and policy related issues involving data ownership and proprietary techniques and formats.  In addition, there can be limits to the use of data obtained from the private sector.  For example, the state of Michigan is collecting data from OnStar, Ford, and Chrysler, but the agreements restricts how the state can use and share the data, and requires that the state delete the data at the end of the project.    Open data and open standards The availability of privately owned, continuously collected data has the potential to improve evaluations but may also increase the complexity of conducting evaluations.  This issue calls for the development of data standards for data definitions, means of collection, and format.  In this context, the participants highlighted the need for open data and open standards.  (The domain of transit provides an example of a model in which agencies and vendors provide data in open data formats.  Subsequently, agencies and entrepreneurs have developed new and innovative transit applications.)  Impact on federal regulations Innovative technologies may force changes and updates in federal regulations.  For example, requirements for the federal evaluation processes used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Transit Agency (FTA) do not appear to be up-to-date with changes introduced by innovative technologies.  Further, litigation may limit the use of some of the new technologies.  Real-time monitors The participants identified ¡°24/7¡± real-time monitoring as a major factor in evaluation.  The key to its usefulness is to deploy a robust network of real-time monitors.  Although the monitors provide greater coverage compared to previous methods, it is not clear how much detail they can provide or how useful the measures will be.  For example, one private vendor does not provide speed data that is above the speed limit.  In addition, much work is required to translate continuous data streams into performance measures and actionable information for operations and evaluation.  Further, agencies will have to integrate the new sources of data into legacy systems.  (Other innovative techniques such as mob and crowd sourcing provide innovative approaches for data collection but also require validation before they can provide useful information.)     -5- Video and data streaming have new capabilities and allow for different types of evaluation.  A participant had used video for post-incident analysis of field operational responses to incidents and for providing feedback to field staff.  However, legal concerns may prevent an agency from saving video recordings on a regular basis, thus requiring personnel to monitor video for incidents and put forward a request to save the recording when an incident occurs.   Participants noted that another transformational change is the ability to provide feedback in real-time (based on information from real-time monitors) to users of the transportation system.  This interaction adds a complicating dynamic to the transportation system, affecting how best to conduct before/after evaluations.  Learn from others Participants noted that it is worthwhile for the ITS evaluation community to review how other organizations conduct evaluations, including the following. ¡þ What can we learn from Google?  Google collects huge quantities of data from the Internet and has a working culture based around collecting and transforming data into knowledge.   ¡þ Defense Advances Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has a process for evaluating and tracking new technologies.   HOW CAN WE BEST AND MOST CREATIVELY EVALUATE NEW JPO INITIATIVES?  The facilitator framed this question in terms of meeting the major transportation goals of safety, mobility and environment as presented in the ITS Strategic Research Plan.  Participants contributed the following ideas, among others.  Include negative as well as positive results The participants noted that the evaluation of JPO initiatives must include both the negative and positive impacts and results.  It is just as important for evaluation results to reveal what has not worked as well as what has worked in order to pursue promising research and deployments.    Operations and maintenance are important criteria in evaluations Participants emphasized the importance of operations and maintenance as an area that should be included in evaluation efforts on a continuous basis.  Evaluating the operations and maintenance of ITS projects over time distinguishes between the practices that continue to provide benefits from those that have reached the end of their useful life.  Traditional ITS technologies and applications still require evaluation Many participants expressed the concern that, even as we work toward developing new technologies, we must continue to evaluate the large amount of existing ¡°traditional¡± ITS technologies maintained and deployed across the country.  The evaluation program should continue to support traditional deployments, even as it works to evaluate new research areas and technologies.   -6- Engage the public Several participants indicated the importance of engaging the public and evaluating how travelers behave over time.  They stressed the importance of measuring customer satisfaction and documenting how driver behavior and customer satisfaction are important factors in determining overall system benefits.  WHAT INNOVATIONS ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT CAN BE APPLIED, OR HAVE POTENTIAL TO BE APPLIED, FOR EVALUATION?  The participants discussed the following specific topics in response to this question.  Mobile devices as a tool for traveler input (¡°an electronic diary¡±) Mobile devices enable new ways of collecting traveler experiences and input in real-time, as they occur.  Mobile devices have potential advantages over traditional means of gathering customer data such as telephone surveys, questionnaires or focus groups by collecting data in real-time (or nearly real-time), and over periods of time.    Internet and social media as tools for outreach  Agencies are currently using the Internet as a means to obtain feedback from the traveling public.  For example, Minnesota DOT (Mn/DOT) developed an Internet-based program dedicated to collecting input from the public on projects for specific corridors and engaging the public in planning, implementation and evaluation activities.  Other state DOTs use Facebook to inform citizens of transportation news, projects, etc.   Technological advances are making environmental sensors smaller  The miniaturization of weather sensors is an example of a technological advance that supports traffic operations and maintenance by improving road weather management.   As road weather stations become smaller, it is easier to install them in urban areas and on arterials.  These weather sensors will provide a rich and continuous source of information on road conditions and performance. For example, New York State has equipped state DOT maintenance trucks with weather sensors.  Mobile sensors Mobile sensors can supplement fixed sensors and turn vehicles into probes.  These technologies include Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), environmental condition sensors for air temperature, and humidity levels.  For example, in Tyson¡¯s Mall in Northern Virginia, Virginia DOT (VDOT) operates kiosks that present traffic information to shoppers.  The data used to compute the traffic information comes from vehicle probe data.  Challenges associated with innovations Technological advances may require institutions to collaborate more closely in terms of sharing data and applying solutions.  The issue raises the question of how to integrate data and systems from different agencies, including county, state, private and public.  Sharing data can benefit many entities.  For example, it is of benefit to many to have interoperable cameras.   -7- Connectivity will produce volumes of data in real-time, introducing the need for new approaches to data processing and analysis.  Analyzing the streams of continuous data will require artificial intelligence, automation and expert systems that use algorithms to process, compile and convert data  into actionable.   HOW DO WE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES?  The discussions surrounding this question revealed that the participants held the opinion that the issue of knowledge transfer is just as important as that of technology transfer, since knowledge underlies the ability to apply technology effectively.  To obtain technology transfer, the participants recommended leveraging the private sector with public/private partnerships.    Incentivize innovations The participants emphasized the need to determine effective means of sharing state and local experiences with ITS deployments.  Crosscutting studies that examine and compare ITS projects across jurisdictions would help illuminate local experiences.  The participants emphasized that there is a need for updated guidelines on how to conduct ITS evaluations. In fact, it may be valuable to have standard guidelines.  The fact that there are a variety of different metrics and computational methods renders it difficult to compare results and anticipate likely outcomes of projects.  Exploit existing knowledge and technology sharing methods The participants identified several ways of sharing knowledge and technologies that take advantage of existing communication methods, including the following:   ¡þ State chapters of ITS America provide a ready means to exchange knowledge about technologies and methods. American Association of State Highways and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), as national transportation associations, provide good venues to share information. ¡þ Exploit conferences, workshops, and other peer exchange mechanisms. ¡þ Facilitate the use of list servers among communities of practice.  List servers exist now but are under-utilized in some cases, simply because people are not aware of them. For example, the International Benefits, Evaluation and Costs Working Group (IBEC) list serve is a mechanism for sharing ITS evaluation information.  A portal could link transportation professionals to a variety of list servers. ¡þ Use existing channels such as the Federal Highway Administration¡¯s local technical assistance programs (LTAPS), even if they have not been traditionally used for ITS.   Suggestions for improving the effectiveness of knowledge and technology sharing Participants suggested developing a one-stop shop for technology transfer and education, since having many disparate sites risks a piecemeal transfer of knowledge.  Participants also noted that having access to interim findings from ongoing projects is valuable (as opposed to waiting for final results).  In addition, to be effective, technology transfer material should be relevant, short, concise, and tailored according to the needs of the targeted end users.     -8- HOW DO WE OBTAIN AND BEST SHARE MEANINGFUL EVALUATION TECHNIQUES AND RESULTS?  Key observations from the breakout session included the following:  There are barriers to producing and sharing meaningful results There is a perception that sharing negative results risks scrutiny, criticism, or worse, an audit.  Agencies that conduct self-evaluations have a lingering perception that an evaluation that reports negative results will trigger scrutiny.  One participant said, ¡°An evaluation is an audit.¡± Participants expressed the view that agencies do not readily share results with industry. ¡þ Self-evaluations are likely to have a bias toward reporting positive results, due to organizational self-interest. ¡þ Conducting self-evaluations is costly and time-consuming.  As noted by a participant, an evaluation is a ¡°project in itself.¡±  Thus, there must be a sufficiently strong incentive and/or enough resources for agencies to conduct objective self-evaluations.  Remedies to the barriers listed above ¡þ Sponsor evaluation activities separately from the research or deployment project. ¡þ Ensure that evaluation results become available to the public. ¡þ Use a third party to conduct evaluations to help avoid a conflict of interest. ¡þ Use evaluation as a tool for deployment in which evaluators and deployment staff meet at the outset and at the mid-term of a project to enable mid-course corrections. ¡þ Evaluations should assess the public impact of a project.  Geographic relevance and transferability The participants described the importance of geographical relevance of ITS benefits.  The question is whether benefits realized by a deployment in one location will generalize to other locations.  The participants noted the complexities of determining geographical relevancy of results.  Even the same location can undergo substantial changes in infrastructure, population growth and traffic patterns that influence the outcome of a project deployed over a long period, affecting the ability to evaluate the project¡¯s benefits.  Nonetheless, the participants indicated that integrating geographical relevance would enhance the ITS Knowledge Resources and benefits database.  It was noted that the transferability of a benefit depends also upon the audience for that benefit.  For example, the mayor of a city interested in sustainable solutions may be keen on learning about the benefits from deployments in a ¡°green¡± city (e.g., Chicago).  In contrast, a traffic engineer modeling signal timing is likely to consider the geographical context in detail.    Benefits ¡þ When presenting benefits, it is important to address the operational scenario as well as the technology, because maintenance and operations of a deployment will influence benefits.  Benefits change over time, as well, so it is of value to conduct iterative evaluations.  -9- ¡þ Consider the application of a capability maturity matrix for ITS, similar to the application for planning in operations. ¡þ Selling carbon credits requires measuring benefits over time; it would be valuable to compare previous evaluations to subsequent ones for verification of outcomes (benefits).  Importance of and timing of evaluation The value and relevance of an evaluation increase with the risk of a project. Thus, it may be more effective to spend evaluation resources on projects having increased risk.  Participants noted that at some point it may not be necessary to evaluate ITS technologies that have proven, known benefits.  For example, transportation agencies know much about Dynamic Message Signs (DMS), but some agencies still require evaluations of DMS projects to justify their deployment.  ITS Knowledge Resources Participants made the following comments on the value of the Knowledge Resources and ways of improving the benefits, costs and lessons learned databases: ¡þ It would be helpful if there were a means for users to add information to the databases.  ¡þ The Knowledge Resources are an excellent application; continue to build upon it and do not neglect it. ¡þ Users are interested in seeing similar benefits integrated into benefits ¡°packages.¡±  ¡þ The databases do not provide an integrated, comprehensive overview.  It would be useful to categorize benefits by user type (e.g., elected official or transportation planner) and by geographic characteristics.  Performance-based management Participants noted that performance-based management will be a ¡°game-changer¡± and that the next authorization for the U.S. DOT is likely to emphasize performance measurement.  Performance-based management will require agencies to prove that they spent funds effectively and to show that performance continually improves.  This requirement implies that evaluations will continue to serve an important function in the ITS program.     HOW DO WE MEASURE AND EVALUATE LIVABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RELATED GOALS? The facilitator introduced this topic by highlighting the importance of evaluating ITS in terms that make sense for livability and environmentally related goals.  Although framing ITS in the context of environmental benefits is not a new concept, what is new is the increasing importance of sustainability as a factor in planning and deployment decisions.  Participants in general agreed that methods and tools for measuring environmental impacts already exist, but that capturing livability and sustainability is less understood and involves concepts that can be subjective.  Further, their importance may change from place-to-place and over time.  A thought-provoking suggestion from the participants was to develop a policy analysis tool that connects sustainability to day-to-day operations.  The tool would examine the tradeoffs between the  -10- three dimensions of mobility, societal impacts, and the environment as a function of changes in daily conditions.  The relative priorities and importance of the three dimensions may change depending on the situation.  For example, a code-red air quality day could trigger changes in operations to reduce emissions.  Participants contributed feedback in several main categories, presented below:  ITS and carbon offsets Participants described a project in Portland, Oregon, in which the Climate Trust, a non-profit organization, contracted with the City of Portland to buy carbon offsets from an advanced traffic signal deployment project.  The project improved the timing of traffic signals in 17 major arterials in the Portland area, resulting in increased efficiency of traffic flow and reduced idling and acceleration time.  The Climate Trust helped provide the resources needed for city agencies to model, develop and deploy the traffic signal system. This example underscores the value in developing the evaluation techniques that demonstrate the environmental benefits of ITS.  Similarly, the San Diego Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) included ITS as one of the ways to meet greenhouse gas emissions requirements mandated by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).  The RTP views ITS as a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks by seven percent per capita by 2020 and 13 percent by 2035 (as required by CARB).  Livability Addressing livability requires that we first establish the values, goals, objectives, and measures of livability.  Participants indicated that guidance on how to assess livability is desirable in the context of ITS project evaluations.  Livability consists of many components: pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, and average commute time, among others.  Travel time in general is also a measure of livability, but improving travel introduces the risk that it rewards or encourages people to take more trips.    Vehicle and infrastructure connectivity, air quality and carbon emissions ITS research involving connectivity will include evaluation of air quality and carbon emissions.  Air quality is a localized result, having local impacts, whereas carbon emissions have a global impact, not a local one.  There is potential for vehicle-to-infrastructure applications to reduce the number of high accelerations and decelerations, improving acceleration profiles and lowering emissions.   Commercial vehicle operations (CVO) and other modes CVO have a significant impact on air quality and carbon emissions.  By next year, New York State¡¯s Commercial Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (CVII) program will have at least five wireless roadside inspection screening sites.  CVO and its applications provide a controlled population and a good testing ground for understanding how advanced technologies and connectivity affect the environment.  The Integrated Corridor Management program provides an opportunity for operators in each mode to coordinate systems and practices.  The extent to which the operators receive credit for working towards a coordinated system with all of the modes is crucial to their efforts.  Evaluating current ITS impacts still important A participant emphasized that it is still important that we understand the impacts of current (and legacy) ITS solutions, even in the face of new projects and concepts such as connectivity.  There is still a need to assess present-day ITS deployments, such as ramp meters, incident management, etc.  -11- For example, Hampton Roads has struggled for 10 years to capture and prove the environmental impacts of traffic incident management.  At this point, there is truly no proven method in place to justify such projects in statewide or local transportation improvement programs.  SUMMARY  The participants contributed a wide range of ideas throughout the workshop.  Among the themes expressed by the participants are the following: Benefits ¡þ The location and context of the benefit is an important factor in evaluating ITS. It is necessary to characterize the geographical relevance of a benefit before extrapolating results. Timeframe of evaluation and iterative testing ¡þ There is value in iterative evaluation and incremental, deployments, with smaller evaluation reports produced at interim periods aimed at allowing adjustments.  Thus, reporting benefits and sharing results on an interim basis should be encouraged. ¡þ Using multiple test sites, not just one large site, for research projects allows testing under different conditions with multiple risk factors. Maintenance and operations ¡þ Include maintenance and operations costs in evaluation and in the ITS Knowledge Resources.  ¡þ Costs should include not only capital costs at initial installation but also maintenance and operations costs over time. Learn from others ¡þ Learn from organizations such as the FAA that use large real-time databases.  See what they do, how they manage the data, how they structure the databases. ¡þ Learn from other domains, particularly the banking industry, on how they conduct self-evaluations.   Self-evaluations ¡þ Encourage self-evaluations by incorporating them into the project management process.  ¡þ Capture positive and negative impacts of deployments.  Including negative results not only improves the quality of the report but also the credibility of the information. Data Sharing  -12- ¡þ Sharing data is a key factor in successful deployments and it strengthens the cooperation between entities.   Sustainability ¡þ Framing ITS in the context of the environment is not a new concept, but what is new is the extent to which sustainability is a factor in transportation planning and deployment decisions. ¡þ Sustainability requires that we take a fresh look at the measures for assessing the impact of ITS on the environment.  A tool that examines the tradeoffs between mobility and environment goals as a function of daily conditions has potential, so that, for example, the goal of reducing emissions may override mobility goals on ¡°high ozone days.¡±  NEXT STEPS  Envisioned as an initial exchange with stakeholders, the JPO program managers designed this workshop to share knowledge on how ITS evaluation can best support the ITS Strategic Research Plan, and state and local ITS projects.  As the landscape of ITS continues to evolve, it will be increasingly valuable for stakeholders to continue the discussion on advancing practices in ITS evaluation.

These Knowledge Resources assist decision makers, state/local government agencies, and researchers in realizing the costs, benefits, and lessons learned of ITS, as well as understanding the underlying technologies and how they have been deployed.  The paper discusses how the authors created and launched a Home page that provided an integrated entry point to access the Knowledge Resources, while simultaneously offering new features, such as a mapping and a tag cloud/top searches feature.  These new features offer users different ways to visualize and access the ITS information, and see relationships between the data previously unseen, and thereby get more value out of existing and future ITS evaluation information, via the Knowledge Resources databases.    Key words:  ITS Knowledge Resources, home page, location mapping, tag cloud   INTRODUCTION  The ITS Knowledge Resources include a series of five related Web sites and databases, including ITS Benefits, ITS Costs, ITS Lessons Learned, ITS Deployment Statistics, and ITS Applications Overview.  The goal of these databases is to assist decision makers, state and local government agencies, and researchers in realizing the costs, benefits, and lessons learned of ITS,   2 as well as understanding the underlying technologies and how they have been deployed.  Because these databases are on separate (but connected) Web sites, a Home page was developed to provide a fast and easy central access point, and to tie these sites together in a visually and functionally cohesive way.   INTEGRATING THE KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES DATABASES IN ONE HOME PAGE  The ITS Knowledge Resources Home page integrates the five Knowledge Resources databases, as well as tying together a novel mapping application, social media connectivity (transportation related RSS feeds, twitter page, and blogs), Help information, comment and feedback mechanisms, and a tag cloud showing users¡¯ top searches.  The Home page interface provides an easy to use, centralized access point for all the Knowledge Resources databases and related functions.  See Figure 1 and www.ITSKnowledgeResources.its.dot.gov.  The new Home page also provides an effective and convenient way to offer new features, and solicit user feedback.  This paper will focus on two new features, the mapping feature (Map Entries) and the tag cloud, that displays users¡¯ top keyword searches.      3  Figure 1. ITS Knowledge Resources Home page.  MAPPING FEATURE Both the Mapping feature and the Tag cloud feature provide users with a more graphical interface and allow them to visualize the data more effectively.  Geographically referenced information (i.e., information associated with specific locations) has long been used by various government agencies to allow its users to view, understand, question, interpret, and visualize the data that the agencies are sharing.  The Mapping feature utilizes the Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface) to display the database information and is accessed through the ¡°Map Entries¡± link in the upper right hand corner of the home page and each of the database sites. Some of the key features of the mapping application are shown in Figure 2 including:      4 ¡þ Tabs for moving among each of the Benefits, Costs, and Lessons Learned maps, or viewing a combined map of all three. ¡þ Mapping of the location of database records that are close to one another in clusters. ¡þ Display of the information thematically by relevant goal area. ¡þ Search and display the geographic distribution of the benefits, costs and Lessons learned by: ITS application, Goal area, or Lessons category. ¡þ Search for information for a specific coded location. ¡þ Search for information near a specific location (proximity search). ¡þ Search results displayed in a sidebar on the left side of the map page. When a side bar entry is clicked, the related location marker in the map is highlighted and an infowindow opens displaying the record headline and other summary information. ¡þ A ¡°Beta¡± version that provides more detailed clusters and the ability to toggle clustering on and off.  Sidebar shows list of recordsMove between maps by clicking on tabsSearch by classificationsSearch by coded locationFind records near a location (proximity)Maps location(s) of all records found by their related goal areas.Click on a marker to see more informationClick on a sidebar link to see more information and where it is on the map.Option to use Beta version for modern browsers Figure 2. ITS Knowledge Resources Mapping Features.  Mapping provides a new way of accessing and viewing the Knowledge Resource information (benefits, costs, and lessons learned) that can reveal new relationships and patterns. More specifically, it allows users to see and understand the geographic patterns of information in the database, and the proximity of entries to one other.  This is especially powerful when searching for and displaying the geographic distribution of entries for a particular technology or application.  For example, you can ask the question ¡°Where is the transit related information located?¡± The results are displayed on a map, as shown in Figure 3.  This capability provides a better understanding of the question in a regional context.  Combined searches such as the   5 ¡°Transit Management¡± applications that relate to the ¡°Energy & Environment,¡± or ¡°Safety¡± goals can also be carried out.   Figure 3. Transit related benefits, costs, and lessons learned.  When an individual marker or sidebar is clicked an infowindow opens displaying the headline, related goals and other information about the selected record. The user can then click on the ¡°View details¡± link in order to view the detailed information displayed in the record summary of the benefits, costs, or lessons learned database pages. For clusters, a scrolling infowindow opens, providing the user the ability to see and scroll through all of the entries that have the same location. This is a custom feature developed for the Knowledge Resources mapping. An example of a scrolling infowindow for ¡°Chicago, Illinois¡± is shown in Figure 4.     6   Figure 4. Clustering and scrolling Infowindow to show entries with the same location.  Proximity searching providing the ability to find all of the records with X miles of a location is especially useful. For example, the entries within the Washington DC area are easily identified through mapping, even though their specific locations may include Washington, DC; Montgomery County, MD; Silver Spring, MD; Tysons Corner, VA; and Fairfax, VA. (See Figure 5 for an illustration.)  Previously, the user would have had to know of each location and carry out repeated searches of the database to capture all of these locations.    Figure 5. Benefit Records within 50 miles of Washington DC (clustering off).   7  In the future, the mapping feature will be integrated into all of the Knowledge Resources pages and functions.  The team is exploring combining the location mapping with place characteristics.  This would allow the examination of questions such as, ¡°Are the benefits or costs different from large, medium, small areas or rural areas?¡±  Another possibility for a future enhancement is to allow others to access the information and create data mash-ups to display the Knowledge Resource data (benefits, costs, lessons learned) for their particular area or topic on their own websites.  Such mash-ups could amplify the power of the ITS Knowledge Resources data by allowing others to combine, aggregate, and visualize the resulting data sets. The mapping features and their utility are just beginning to be explored. Therefore, any feedback on the features would be welcome.  TAG CLOUD FEATURE Tag clouds are a type of visualization technique commonly used in Web 2.0 sites that use tags to show the word content of a site.  Our tag cloud shows the range and relative frequency of keyword search terms used in Knowledge Resources databases.  The size of the tag in the cloud varies proportionately with the frequency of the search.  In other words, the most frequently used search terms have the largest tag (e.g., Changeable Message Signs), whereas the least frequently used search terms have the smallest tag (e.g., call box); see Figure 6.  This is accomplished by counting the frequency of keyword search terms used in the databases, and then ranking the search term frequency into 6 different frequency categories.  The highest frequency level gets the largest tag, whereas the lowest frequency level gets the smallest tag.  By viewing the tag clouds, users can quickly see what other users think are hot topics.  And by looking at the search terms used, ITS practitioners can also get ideas about what search terms to use that may be related to the ones they have tried or are thinking of trying.     Figure 6. Tag Cloud of Top ITS Searches.  When you click on word or phrase in the tag cloud, the system then executes a search based on that word or keyword phrase (e.g., changeable Message Signs), and returns all the benefits, costs, and lessons learned associated with that keyword phrase.  This approach allows users to see what the hot topics are, and to then see what ITS information (i.e., benefits, costs, and lessons learned) are associated with this topic.       8 CONCLUSIONS  We launched the ITS Knowledge Resources Home page on January 24th, 2011, and have already received positive comments from users, both on the appearance of the Home page, as well as the utility of the mapping and tag cloud features.  We anticipate receiving additional comments as more users become familiar with the new Home page and the new features.  We have plans to enhance the utility of both the mapping feature and the Top Searches tag cloud.  We will seek and incorporate user feedback as we continue to enhance the ITS Knowledge Resources Home page, the mapping feature, and the Top Searches tag cloud.

2  INTRODUCTION In 2000, MRCOG created the ITS Subcommittee as a subcommittee to the Transportation Coordinating Committee (TCC), thereby effectively establishing a direct link between ITS planners, engineers, and operators and the region¡¯s transportation decision making body, ie, the Metropolitan Transportation Board.  The charge of the MPO as the transportation planning authority within the metropolitan area presents a unique opportunity to bring stakeholder agencies to the table in a collaborative manner.  The subcommittee is directly involved in the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) committee structure, thus establishing direct input for ITS planners and engineers to transportation planning and programming activities at the regional level.  The committee is comprised of key representatives from each of the MPO member agencies, along with those in the consultant community with an interest in ITS.  Agency representation mimics that of the other committees such as the TCC and MTB.   Regional and agency ITS goals include:  Arterial Management    Freeway Management  Transit Management  Incident and Emergency Management  Traveler Information  Transportation Management Centers   Roadway Operations and Maintenance  MRCOG member agencies comprise the ITS Stakeholders in the Albuquerque Metropolitan Planning Area (AMPA), along with a strong level of participation from the consultant community.  A chapter of ITS America has recently been established and thus far, interest has been strong on both public and private levels of participation.  First responders¡¯ participation is beginning coincident with the NMDOT Freeway Courtesy Patrols and the TMC, and is anticipated to evolve as agency systems expand, putting in place the institutional and structural framework for these relationships evolve.  It presents a challenge for the MRCOG as they are not directly involved in the metropolitan transportation planning process, however, movement on that front is growing as the region pursues the establishment of a regional transportation management center where agency transportation and first responders will co-locate and share information and resources.  At that point, fully coordinated Incident Management can be pursued to its maximum effectiveness.   The coordination of a common regional multi-modal ¡°transportation system¡± has led to a stronger awareness that ITS projects have a greater chance of maximized project benefits for the maximum number of users if planned and implemented properly within the MRCOG Metropolitan Planning Organization.  3  INCLUSION OF ITS IN THE TIP/MTP PROJECT PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING PROCESS The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) (1) is a programming document that prioritizes all transportation funding, including federal funding, for projects within an urbanized area.  The plan is compiled utilizing the collaborative Transportation Planning Process facilitated by the MPO and involving all member agencies.  All projects within the Albuquerque Metropolitan Planning Area (AMPA) receiving federal highway or transit funding, state, or local funding must be in the TIP.  The TIP is the region's mechanism of allocating its limited transportation resources to the multi-modal transportation needs using a clear set of short-term transportation priorities. It is considered the ¡°short range¡± implementation portion of the long range planning Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP) (2).  Projects are identified by project ¡°type¡±, as in roadway, transit, maintenance/rehab, bicycle and pedestrian, and ITS so as to identify primary project ¡°purpose¡± to assist in technical assessment and programming considerations.  Discreet project categories streamlined the process, and the ITS category served larger the projects, however, those non-ITS projects that contained ITS elements were being programmed without consideration of the inclusion of ITS; that is, unless they were specifically identified with a  ¡°project type¡± of ITS those elements were undetected.  The current process was inadequate resulting in many of the ITS components being ¡°undetected¡± in the planning and programming process.  This gap was also making the maintenance of the Regional ITS Architecture extremely difficult as it required cumbersome and exhaustive TIP program review and sponsoring-agency investigation of each project.  The answer was to expand ITS in the TIP development process, both with the inclusion of the ITS Subcommittee into the committee review process flow, as well as the necessary modifications to the project proposal form to assist in identifying a higher detail of ITS elements at the project submittal stage.  Clearly, the process needed the robustness to identify ITS elements on obvious ITS project as well as ¡°non-ITS¡± projects that contain ITS mainstreaming, ie, ITS components being included on other project types such as typical road improvements or transit expansions.    The TIP is developed on a 2-year cycle, and on 4 year cycles is tied to the development of the longer range Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP).  At the beginning of each programming 4  cycle, a call is made to the member agencies to submit their projects for consideration for funding in the program.  Priorities are set forth through the process which is strongly rooted in the Congestion Management Process (CMP) (6) and includes growth projections, financial constraints associated with limited federal, state and local sources, and regional and agency priorities.  The process is facilitated by another subcommittee to the TCC; the Transportation Technical Programming Group (TPTG).  Of note is that many of the members of the TPTG are also on the ITS Subcommittee and the CMP Committee.  The graphic below (Figure 1) shows the basic  process flows related to the program development, and the insert points where the ITS Subcommittee is now involved.      Figure 1.  MRCOG¡¯s TIP Development Process, with ITS Subcommittee involvement identified (Source: MRCOG TIP Policy and Procedures) After the initial project screening, the ITS Subcommittee reviews the total project list including those ITS elements identified as well as projects with the potential for ITS inclusion  A review of the AMPA Regional ITS Architecture and mapping of the projects to the architecture and market packages is then performed which serves as a foundation effort in architecture maintenance.  The ITS Subcommittee is given a second review of the draft TIP before final recommendation to the TCC and then to the MTB for approval. 5  Modifications to the TIP Revision Proposal Form to accommodate necessary detail for ITS inclusion involved adding criteria that simply asks the applicant if their project includes any ITS elements.  To save space on the form, specificity was given to the range of ITS Element options based on a review of the ITS Regional Architecture and regional ITS Goals, however, the form allows for all ITS elements to be specified.  The ITS project ¡°type¡± designation remains in the process for those projects that are identified with a clear and discreet ITS scope, however, this new project definition option affords the applicant the ability to detail any ITS ¡°elements¡± included in the project regardless if the project scope warrants an ¡°ITS¡± project type designation or not.  This modification of the submittal form (and the TIP development process) has led to a significant increase in the amount of ITS elements being ¡°captured¡± through the planning process.  In fact, when first implemented, the capture rate increased from approximately 6 ITS projects in the 2008-2013 TIP  to over 75 in the 2010-2015 TIP.  At the time of this writing the 2012-2017 TIP is at completion and the number of ITS projects identified was 63. The section of the TIP Revision Proposal Form with the ITS detail is shown in Figure 2 below.  For more information, see the TIP Policies and Procedures (2).    Figure 2.  Excerpt of ITS Section from TIP Project Proposal Form (Source: MRCOG TIP Policy and Procedures) ITS CORRIDORS MAP The ITS Subcommittee has identified a network of prioritized corridors used in support of ITS planning and project implementation (see Figure 3). This map is updated as part of the architecture update process and is based on ITS priorities established by individual agencies as well as regional ITS planning efforts over the years including the Regional ITS Implementation Plan, 2004 (3), and the current AMPA Regional ITS Architecture (4). Prioritized ITS corridors are identified, and the map legend includes corresponding reference to the ITS contact information for each stakeholder agency such that any planner, manager, or engineer has direct access to the appropriate ITS contact person, whether it be in their own agency or another agency.  The map is used for a wide range of planning and project development activities such as agency development review, land use plan updates, and project-specific support activities.  A primary benefit of this map is that it effectively extends the reach of ITS to groups and/or planning and project development activities that are beyond the immediate purview of the ITS Subcommittee.  6  The format of the map has been through a few iterations as stakeholders have explored the best manner in which to ¡°capture¡± ITS for input and comment at the key points in the transportation planning process.  It has proven critical that this information be available to the broadest spectrum of planners, engineers, and managers, but more specifically, those not directly involved in ITS or who may not have familiar with the terminology, regional goals, etc.  As such, a simplified version of the map would be needed.  Originally, the regional ITS Corridors Map was a detailed product with a plethora of ITS information and symbology shown.  Although that version of the map reflected regional priorities (based on previous studies)  and whose content was clear to ITS staff, surprisingly, this level of detail became somewhat confusing and overwhelming when viewed by those in the planning process unfamiliar with ITS.  The result was that ITS was going unchecked.  Also, any ITS elements included in non-ITS projects were going undetected, resulting in lost ITS mainstreaming opportunities.   Ironically, by minimizing the level of detail shown on the map and simply identifying corridors along with the appropriate  Figure 3, ITS Corridors Map V1.1 (Source: MRCOG ITS Subcommittee) agency ITS contact information in the legend, the effectiveness of the map has expanded dramatically.  The key in this approach has been to include the contact information on the map, and with direction given to each department manager to contact the appropriate ITS staff for input as necessary.

An example of the effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated recently when a landscaping project being proposed by a municipalities¡¯ Parks and Recreation department crossed the desk of one of the development review/case planners.  The ITS Corridors map was used to contact the appropriate ITS staff whereby the comment for the inclusion of fiber-optic conduit as part of this non-transportation project was made.  Another example of ITS ¡°project mainstreaming¡± and an opportunity for sharing the cost of ITS implementation. ITS CORRIDOR PROFILES Beginning this year (2011), the ITS Subcommittee initiated development of ITS Corridor Profiles comprising common ITS infrastructure and content data identified for existing and near-term deployment focused on a subset of top ranked CMP corridors (Figure 4).  Elements such as telemetry (fiber, conduit, etc), Dynamic Message Signs (DMS), Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) installations, ownership, transit service, and jurisdictional information are included, as well information such as current signal timing plans, memorandums of agreement currently in place or needed, etc.  This collection of information when produced as a single-source ITS product in the form of a corridor ¡°map¡± and associated deployment summary sheet is proving quite informative as ¡°stand-alone¡± information that is being integrated into such efforts as the CMP Committee, presentations to other MRCOG committee such as the TCC and the MTB, agency staff review, or disseminating to the web via the ITS Subcommittee¡¯s page on the MRCOG site.  Further, this data is proving useful for each agency¡¯s own infrastructure accounting and corridor planning efforts when viewing multi-agency corridors. 8   Figure 4, ITS Corridor Profile, Alameda Blvd, CMP Ranking #1 (Source: MRCOG ITS Subcommittee)  Another benefactor group for the ITS Corridor Profiles include CMP members or other staff who are not involved on the ITS Subcommittee or who may not have strong knowledge regarding ITS.  The summary deployment maps are easily referenced in the absence of ITS staff and can be discussed effectively on a project and/or corridor basis.  The product also supports FHWA initiatives as the Every Day Counts Initiative, and its Adaptive Signal Control component.  The example corridor shown above has been considered for inclusion in that program.   THE CONVERGENCE OF COMMITTEES: ITS AND CMP Both the ITS Subcommittee and the CMP Committee are important participants in the MPO¡¯s Transportation Planning Process.  They share the common strategy of Incident Management or Transportation Systems Management using operational improvements associated with the implementation of ITS.  In fact, one of the strategies included in the CMP ¡°Toolbox¡± is ITS.   The CMP (6) is a federal requirement of all MPOs and is used as a management tool for the identification and monitoring of congestion.  It is intended to inform the transportation planning and programming process with a meaningful and objective data-driven process such that scarce 9  transportation dollars are spent in areas of most need, both geographically and congestion/project type.  The CMP is directly integrated in the MRCOG¡¯s transportation planning process and reflects the goals and objectives included in the long range MTP.  A methodology is used to identify congestion, establish corridor ranking, and a methodology for monitoring is in place based on objective measurable criteria.  Three measurable performance indicators utilize data collection programs conducted at MRCOG.  These measures include: 1) volume to capacity ratios, 2) speed differentials, and 3) crash rates.  The transportation system is evaluated and the top 30 ¡°Congested Corridors¡± are identified.  Next, the identification of direct project-level mitigation elements take form of a prioritization process (PPP) used for the ranking of projects proposed for the TIP based on these elements.  The PPP was developed based on three goals from the MTP Goals; they include: 1. Preserve and improve Quality of Life, 2.Mobility of People and Goods, and 3. Support Economic Activity and Growth.  Underlying objectives for each goal further refine the project ranking criteria with objective as well as subjective indicators, and points are awarded to the project accordingly.  A CMP ¡°Toolkit¡± includes a matrix of 32 mitigation strategies comprising main 4 categories, as in:  Active Roadway Management, 8 strategies total; 2 explicitly ITS o Traffic signal timing and coordination, o Traffic signal equipment modernization,  Travel Demand Management/Alternative Travel Modes, 12 strategies total; 3 explicitly ITS o Transit queue jumper and priority, o Electronic fare collection, o Parking management,  Incident Management, 2 strategies total; both ITS o Incident management plans, o Incident response and courtesy patrols,  Physical Roadway Capacity, 10 strategies total, none ITS Note in the categories list above, at least 7 ITS strategies easily fit within 3 of the 4 categories identified. For the full matrix, see the Appendix .   The 30 CMP corridors are identified using the measureable congestion indicators, and comprise the ¡°CMP Network¡±.  The CMP Committee reviews the strategies from the matrix, and prioritizes the strategies as ¡°high¡±, ¡°medium¡±, or ¡°low¡± for each corridor, resulting in a final recommendation matrix to assist in the identification of appropriate project improvements to be programmed in the Transportation Planning Process and the development of the TIP/MTP.  The CMP network is continually monitored for changes in congestion based on growth and travel conditions, but more importantly, for any change or improvement resulting from projects identified as part of the CMP.  The 2 year programming cycle of the TIP, combined with the ongoing data collection described above establishes a built-in monitoring mechanism that offers the opportunity to directly measure congestion mitigation strategies ¨C an invaluable project programming tool for the MPO. The ITS Subcommittee is comprised of ITS stakeholders in the MPO, and includes member agencies as well as some private sector participation.  The inclusion of both private sector and 10  public sector participants has been a windfall opportunity to build regional ITS support, as well as provide additional participation that introduces additional flexibility for the MPO.  MRCOG created the ITS Subcommittee as a subcommittee to the Transportation Coordinating Committee, thereby effectively establishing a direct link between ITS planners, engineers, and operators and the region¡¯s transportation decision making body, ie, the Metropolitan Transportation Board.  Monthly meetings address issues such as ITS projects, the AMPA Regional ITS Architecture including acting as the Architecture Maintenance Group, TIP/MTP project programming, ITS Architecture Standards and Systems Engineering, new and innovative ITS Practices, integration with the CMP, among other items.  Much of the benefits of ITS result from the coordination and cooperation of all ITS ¡°stakeholder¡± agencies within the region and the MRCOG ITS Committee has been established as the forum for ITS planning among MRCOG member agencies and other ITS stakeholders interested in participating. Convergence of the two committees occurs within the transportation planning process with shared representation between MRCOG and agency staff attending at least one, but in some cases both meetings.  Additionally, the two committees coordinate on many levels and MRCOG staff strategize with committee members to capitalize on shared common effort; development of the Congestion Management Process and project priorities, in particular.  The ¡°priority¡± ranking for ITS projects, and especially the identification of those projects that include ITS has been a result of the coordination between the two committees.  Without the ITS Subcommittees input into the CMP project submittal criteria, critical ITS elements were at risk to go undetected in the programming process.  Expansion of data collection and data archiving has benefitted from the two committees coordination efforts.  A mentioned above, the CMP includes congestion data monitoring, and ITS project improvements such as new speed and volume sensors (MVDS), GPS based transit speed data collection, or crash-clearance time monitoring are continually referenced in CMP activities.  Archiving of ITS data collection permits subsequent querying of the data, which is critical in the evaluation of project impact (before and after studies, for example). 11   Figure 4, Combined ITS Corridors and CMP Corridors (Source: MRCOG ITS Subcommittee)    ITS ARCHITECTURE MAINTENANCE, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, AND ITS PROJEC SUPPORT IN THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING CYCLE The baseline Regional ITS Architecture was revised in 2004 with a review and identification of all stakeholders, reassessment of regional ITS goals, and updates based on the current architecture standards and newly adopted market packages.  This update came at a time that presented renewed vigor to a maturing ITS planning and implementation effort in the AMPA as ITS project deployment was emerging beyond small scale individual agency projects to larger scale regionally-integrated projects.  The NMDOT ITS Bureau was implementing a Transportation Management Center with local and statewide capabilities, and municipal stakeholders had their Transportation Operations Centers in varying stages of deployment.  Systems Engineering requirements were becoming forefront in ITS project deployment and it was clear that the MRCOG MPO would have the best opportunity to support the regional integration of ITS consistent with federal requirements and regional ITS goals.   The 2004 baseline architecture established the framework for a renewed ITS planning and project implementation platform. A Maintenance Plan was developed that fully integrates ITS project development into the transportation planning process (as outlined in the previous sections 12  above).  A maintenance ¡°addendum¡± process was established coupled to TIP development that set forth all the mechanisms to ensure that ITS projects would be planned and coordinated with regional ITS goals and a high degree of stakeholder involvement.  The biennial AMPA Regional ITS Architecture Addendum (5)  serves as the current ¡°snapshot¡± of ITS architecture for programmed projects in the following ways:  ITS deployment summary statistics are developed  ITS Market Packages are mapped to the projects in the current TIP  Any changes, regional and national, to the Architecture are noted  Existing ITS Infrastructure Maps are included  Project-level Systems Engineering Project Certification guidance  An example of the TIP project-level Market Package mapping contained in the Addendum is shown in Figure 5 below.  The excerpt is for Category I projects, and shows the project description and ¡°recommended¡± or ¡°agency-proposed¡± market packages as programmed in TIP.  The distinction between the ¡°recommended¡± versus ¡°agency proposed¡± project market packages permits for flexible/phased implementation of ITS within the guidance of the larger baseline Architecture.  Projects are easily referenced for architecture mapping for Systems Engineering certification.  Figure 5, Example of ITS Project Market Package Mapping (Source: 5) The ITS Subcommittee is in charge of maintaining the regional ITS Architecture, and the change management process associated with maintenance activities has proven robust enough to capture nearly all ITS planning and project compliance-related issues experienced thus far.  Ease of use has been a priority of the effort such that the architecture compliance retains a ¡°value added¡±  and is a positive incentive to include ITS elements (unfortunately, ITS has historically suffered from being in the ¡°first to go on the chopping block¡± category when project costs exceed available funding).  As the process matures, the plan is to integrate additional performance improvement criteria into the project evaluation process the further promote ITS, particularly in the performance-based CMP project criteria.    REGIONAL ITS INFRASTRUCTURE GEODATABASE Increased ITS planning activity has necessitated the need for a robust approach to create a common framework to house agency ITS infrastructure deployment data for the region.  A central repository of ITS deployment data can serve planning purposes of the MPO ¡¯s regional 13  coordination perspective, assist project integration, facilitate resource sharing, coordinate data collection, and promote integrated system management among all stakeholders.   ITS infrastructure is like any other capitol asset, and as such is included in agency database and inventory monitoring activities.  The ITS Subcommittee identified additional capability needs beyond that of a simple flat-file inventory; the desired platform would need to provide expanded capability such as regional summaries and/or mapping of existing deployments in support of maintaining the Regional ITS Architecture, corridor-specific ITS deployment information to assist in ITS and other non-ITS project-level analysis and design, or ITS infrastructure gap-analysis to identify additional needs or functionality.   The choice was clear that the platform be in a geographic information system (GIS), and that it live in the ESRI ArcGIS world.  The ESRI ArcGIS platform was chosen due to the widespread familiarity and extensive data development in New Mexico (we are considered an ESRI state, meaning that the vast majority of GIS users rely on ESRI¡¯s ArcGIS platform).  Once the decision was made to proceed in GIS, key participants were identified from both ITS and GIS for each stakeholder and a user¡¯s group was formed. Nearly all stakeholder agencies maintain GIS and as it turned out, some in GIS were beginning to include ITS assets in their infrastructure inventory and pavement management activities.  An effort on the part of the City of Albuquerque to inventory their entire ITS infrastructure was taking shape, and similar efforts by the NMDOT, Bernalillo County, and Rio Rancho had begun.  The opportunity was there for the ITS Subcommittee to facilitate an expansion of the City¡¯s project to a larger effort to incorporate regional needs by allowing the inclusion of additional GIS features identified by the stakeholders.  A new level of inter-departmental coordination among ITS and GIS staff was emerging which would ensure that this effort to create a regional geodatabase (rgdb) for ITS Infrastructure would be successful. The user group involving GIS staff and ITS staff to develop and implement the rgdb meets regularly.   The first major step was to agree on the set of GIS ¡°features¡± that would comprise the geodatabase.  A universe of ITS elements was soon identified to satisfy all agency needs, and what was clear was that DOT and municipalities¡¯ database needs were different.  A range of ITS feature classes with associated attributes necessary to meet the composite of agency needs was finalized in what is referred to in GIS terms as a ¡°schema¡±.  These feature class elements include:  Closed Circuit TVs (CCTVs) ¨C point feature, with attributes    Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) ¨C point feature, with attributes   Pole ¨C point feature, with attributes as a central mounting device for ITS elements  Pull-Boxes ¨C point feature, with attributes  Service Connections  ¨C point feature, with attributes  System Cabinets ¨C point feature, with attributes  Telemetry ¨C line feature, with attributes  VDS/Sensors ¨C point feature, with attributes 14  Each feature class contains an extensive set of detailed attributes such as owner, manufacture, type, serial identification, maintenance history, image, etc. such that the geodatabase will serve the planning and project development needs of ITS stakeholders as well as provide the level of detail that agency public works inventory and/or Roadway Management program requirements.   Initially, the desktop ArcGIS platform was identified, and, combined with the consistency of a common schema, was looking promising.  Each stakeholder would develop and maintain their respective datasets, and the MRCOG would maintain the regional dataset comprised of all stakeholder inputs.  ArcGIS Server would be employed to serve the composite regional geodatabase.  A robust database maintenance framework was identified as critical to retaining accuracy and currency of the data.  With these early decisions essentially made, focus continued on developing and refining the schema, and it was during that time and prior to any data integration that ESRI released the web-based ArcGIS.com, which provides a web-based platform with ease of use, and increased access and operability.  With the new platform ¡°on the cloud¡± and essentially free to users, many of the integration and maintenance hurdles facing the effort were lowered significantly.   Figure 6, Regional Geodatabase; Structure, Stakeholders, and Data Flows The unified schema has established regional congruency that brings all datasets into a common framework, which has provided utility for ITS project planning and project deployment monitoring, as well as other public-works related activities indirectly related to ITS, such as communications sharing, infrastructure query, maintenance activities, and related infrastructure project development.   Figure 6 above shows the GIS environment and framework that supports the regional ITS gdb. Each stakeholder agency has GIS capabilities, and data maintenance activities remain in-house.  The web-based ArcGIS.com environment allows for individual updates to the regional dataset by each agency, and permits the data to be uploaded to the ¡°cloud¡±, thus eliminating any concern over security, firewalls, etc.  15  COLLABORATIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING ENVIRONMENT, FUTURE SUCCESS OF ITS In capitalizing on the collaborative environment of a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) where all transportation agencies and all travel modes are represented, MRCOG has successfully integrated ITS project development into the transportation planning process in a manner that can ensure that ITS stakeholder needs are considered and efforts coordinated effectively.  Further integration with ITS stakeholders in the MRCOG region will be had as ITS takes the next step with a near term project for a Regional TMC.  This project will consolidate some transportation operations and roadway maintenance activities, will involve regional transit operators, and will also directly involve first responders and expanded Incident Management activities on freeways and arterials in the AMPA.                   16  REFERENCES: 1.

This paper presents the challenges faced by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in developing design-build contracts for the delivery of ITS on several large design-build transportation projects over the last ten years. This paper describes the two-phase selection process ¨C Request-for-Qualification (RFQ) and Request-for-Proposal (RFP), and innovated procurement strategies that WSDOT has used on its design-build contracts with a focus on ITS delivery. A key discussion will include how to use the Systems Engineering Process (SEP) in design-build and how to provide flexibility and encourage design-build contractor (design-builder) innovation while meeting existing system integration requirements.  This paper also outlines several significant findings from the recent SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV design-build projects. Finally, recommendations are provided for addressing ITS delivery issues on large design-build transportation projects.   Key Words: ITS, Design-Build, Transportation   1. INTRODUCTION  Design-build is a method of project delivery in which a project owner executes a single contract with one entity (the design-builder) for both engineering design and construction services to provide a finished project. In 1990, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) established Special Experimental Project No. 14 - Innovative Contacting (SEP-14) to enable transportation agencies to use alternative project contracting methods that provide the potential for expedited project delivery in a more cost-effective manner as well as provide better or equivalent project quality. Design-build was one of the main contracting methods - 2 -  included in SEP-14. Since that time, design-build has gained popularity and become one of the most employed non-traditional project delivery methods on Federal-aid transportation projects by numerous agencies. According to FHWA (reference 1), there are more than 300 design-build transportation projects that have been approved under SEP-14. By the end of 2002, there were a wide range of design-build project sizes from $0.4 million to $1.1 billion. In 2003, FHWA implemented regulations ¨C the Design-Build Contracting Final Rule (reference 2) ¨C for allowing the use of design-build contracting for selected projects by the State Transportation Departments (STD) as an optional tool in addition to traditional contracting methods.   2. SUITABILITY OF ITS DELIVERY USING DESIGN-BUILD CONTRACTING   Among those design-build transportation projects approved under SEP-14, a small portion include project scopes of work that are principally ITS, but these projects (less than $14 million) are much smaller than those mega projects over $100 million in cost. According to the survey results included in the FHWA's 2006 "Design-Build Effectiveness Study" Final Report (reference 3), the suitability for design-build contracting was highly correlated to the size of the project ¨C the larger the size of the transportation project, the more contracting agencies intend to use the design-build contracting method. As shown in Figure 1 below excerpt from this report, the perception of design-build program managers surveyed in this study varies based on different type and size of the projects including road widening/new construction, road rehabilitation/reconstruction, bridge and tunnel, ITS, and road resurface projects, where ITS projects were rated moderately lower than the other projects such as road widening/new construction, road rehabilitation/reconstruction, bridge and tunnel, which are typically much larger project in cost.   Figure 1 - Perceived Suitability of Design-Build Project Delivery (Scale: 1 ¨C Not Suitable; 6 ¨C Highly Suitable)       The design-build contracting method of project delivery is certainly not appropriate for all transportation projects, but when the right projects are selected, design-build often offers - 3 -  significant benefits in comparison to the traditional design-bid-build contracts. According to the survey results included in the FHWA¡¯s ¡°Current Design-Build Practices for Transportation Projects¡± (reference 4), many STDs indicated that accelerated project delivery and cost certainty are the two major factors in their decision to use design-build. The FHWA's 2006 "Design-Build Effectiveness Study" Final Report (reference 3) also concluded that design-build reduces the overall project duration, and most likely provides cost savings without compromising project quality in comparison to the traditional design-bid-build projects.     The following sections of this paper highlight WSDOT¡¯s current design-build practices and further discuss the issues emerged during the design-build procurement for ITS, and provide lessons learned from the design-build procurement strategies that WSDOT utilized to avoid or reduce the potential negative impacts these issues create.   3. WSDOT DESIGN-BUILD PRACTICES   In 1998, the Washington State Legislature authorized approval for a pilot design-build program.  Since then, design-build has become a major project delivery method that WSDOT has used to deliver the major transportation projects.     3.1 WSDOT Design-Build Procurement Process  When compared to the traditional design-bid-build process, delivering a project using design-build contracting still requires the same project work tasks and products whether performed by the owner or the design-builder; however, due to the project timing, funding, level of task detail performed, the design-build process shifts some tasks and responsibility from the owner to the design-builder. The owner¡¯s responsibility is typically front-loaded in the design-build process and after the design-builder is selected, the responsibility of delivering the project is transferred from the owner to the design-builder. The design-build process that WSDOT has adopted consists of the following steps: ¡þ Select appropriate projects for design-build ¡þ Conduct two-phase procurement process to select the design-builder ¡þ Perform contract administration and design-build oversight    Which Transportation Projects are selected for Design-Build?  After the project scope is adequately developed and a risk analysis is completed, WSDOT will make the final decision whether or not a project is to use design-build contracting based on project funding, environmental clearances, public outreach, right-of-way acquisitions,  preliminary geotechnical investigations, interagency agreements, and utility agreements with utility companies for relocation of their facilities.  The contracting decision is generally not based on the project type. In some cases, expedited project delivery schedule and workforce constraints may also play an important role in selection of the design-build contracting method especially for very large projects. Smaller projects such as specialty work like a standalone ITS project may present opportunities for specific benefits if selected as design-build; however, the risks must be low in comparison to potential benefits and must be clearly identified during the decision making process. Current Washington State Law requires a minimum of project size of $10 million, but there is no maximum project size limit.   - 4 -  What is the Two-Phase Procurement Process? According to the WSDOT¡¯s ¡°Guidebook for Design-Build Highway Project Development¡± (reference 5), the WSDOT¡¯s design-build procurement consists of two phases ¨C Request for Qualification (RFQ) and Request for Proposal (RFP). The RFQ and RFP are separate documents developed to conduct the solicitation process and then make the final selection of the design-builder. Figure 2 illustrates the two-phase procurement process implemented by WSDOT.  Figure 2 ¨C WSDOT Two-Phase Procurement Process    The RFQ asks interested proposers to submit a well defined package - Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) - outlining historical information related to capabilities, experience and past performances on specific issues pertinent to the design-build project, project understanding, project team organization, and quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) approach. Three top ranked proposers are typically selected during this step.   The RFP is the next step to solicit proposals from the short-listed proposers and to select a winning proposal by using the Apparent Best Value (ABV) scoring system. The RFP is comprised of the defined contract provisions as well as the selection process requirements and criteria. The RFP Package describes the project, the requirements for submitting proposals, the proposal evaluation process, the technical requirements for designing and constructing the project, and the contract terms.    After the RFP is released but before the proposers submit their proposals, WSDOT generally conduct one-on-one meetings with each of the shortlisted proposers which allows them to submit Alternative Technical Concepts (ATC) in order to promote innovation by proposers and to maintain flexibility in the procurement process. The proposers¡¯ ATCs may modify the Basic Configuration of the project or other contract requirements, but must provide a project that is ¡°equal or better¡± on an overall basis than the project would be without the proposed Potential?Bidders?Submit?SOQEvaluate?&?Determine?ShortlistersDetermine?&?Announce?ABV?@?Bid?OpeningEvaluate?Technical?ProposalsRelease?Final?RFPOne©\on©\One?MeetingsDevelop/Release?RFP?AddendaRelease?RFP?to??ShortlistersRelease?RFQ?to?Potential?BiddersDevelop?RFQProject?Selected?for?Design©\BuildDevelop?RFPQualification PhaseApprove/Disapprove?ATCsShortlistersSubmit?ATCsShortlistersSubmit?Proposals?&?Bid?PriceContract?Award?&?ExecutionDetermine?Technical?ScoresProposal Phase- 5 -  ATC. Concepts that simply delete scope, lower performance requirements, lower standards, or reduce contract requirements are not acceptable as ATCs.   After the proposers submit their proposals, WSDOT conducts technical evaluation of the proposal to derive the technical scores of the proposals using the evaluation process stated in the RFP. The ABV for each proposal is calculated based on the technical scores and the actual bid prices, and is announced at the bid opening.    Finally, at the time of contract award, the RFP and the winning proposal are combined to form the final contract document that will govern throughout the life of the design-build project.   3.2 WSDOT Large Design-Build Projects  After successful administration of many relatively smaller design-build projects, WSDOT has recently started to procure a few mega-projects (contract value is greater than $100 million) using the design-build contracting method. Table 1 illustrates nine large design-build transportation projects with significant ITS work included. All projects were awarded by WSDOT in recent years except for the SR 520 Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and Landings Design-Build Project that will be awarded in August, 2011. As shown in this table, the Alaskan Way Viaduct-SR 99 Bored Tunnel Project is the largest design-build project that WSDOT has awarded to date.   Table 1 - WSDOT Design-Build Projects with ITS Work Included Design-Build Project Year Awarded Winning Proposal Price* ITS Work** Active Traffic Management (ATM) System 2009 $34.5 million (1), (2), (3), (7) SR 532 Corridor Improvements  2009 $50.4 million (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) SR 519/I-90 Intermodal Access Interchange Improvements Phase 2 2008 $66.9 million (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) I-405, I5 to SR 169 Stage 2 Widening and  SR 515 Interchange 2009 $83.6 million (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) I-405, I5 to SR 169 Stage 1 Widening 2007 $91.5 million (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) I-405/NE 8th St to SR 520 Braided Ramps - Interchange Improvements 2009 $107.5 million (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) SR 520 - Medina to SR 202: Eastside Transit and HOV  2010 $306.3 million (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) SR 520 Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and Landings 2011 (anticipated)$750 million (Upset amount in RFP) (1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (8) Alaskan Way Viaduct-SR 99 Bored Tunnel 2010 $1,089.7 million (1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (9) *  The winning proposal price may be different from the ABVs determined by WSDOT.  ** (1) Active Traffic Management (ATM) System  (2) CCTV Traffic Surveillance System  (3) Traffic Detection and Data Collection System  (4) Ramp Metering  (5) Traffic Signals  (6) All Electronic Tolling System  (7) Fiber optic communication system  (8) Emergency traffic signals and tunnel lighting control systems  (9) Tunnel systems (lighting, ventilation, fire life safety, emergency response, etc.) - 6 -   Except for the Active Traffic Management (ATM) Design-Build Project that consisted of almost 100% ITS design and construction work, all other eight projects are large multi-disciplinary design-build transportation projects with contract values exceeding $50 million. Among these eight projects, ITS only represents a very small portion of the total contract price (less than 5%), while the majority of the project cost comes from major civil work, including bridge replacement, tunnel construction, and/or roadway widening and new construction work.     4. ITS IN LARGE DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS   When ITS is included in the scope of large design-build projects, the design-build contracting process can provide the similar benefits for ITS as other project scope elements when delivered as part of a large project; however, the design-build program managers often face different challenges during project contracting and management in dealing with issues due to the implementation of ITS.   In most large design-build transportation projects, ITS represents only a small percentage of the total project. The low percentage of ITS work appears to be a common characteristic of almost all large design-build transportation projects that are heavily dominated by the civil work. However, ITS is a very critical integral component of these large projects and is considered significant from the agencies¡¯ operational and safety perspective. Implementing ITS effectively provides substantial long-term benefits to the public and the operating agencies; therefore, its importance should not be overlooked or underestimated by the contracting agencies or the design-builders.   4.1 ITS Challenges in the Design-Build Process   ITS delivery needs are often overlooked in the design-build procurement of large civil projects. Because of the low percentage of ITS work in large civil contracts from an overall cost perspective, ITS may not draw attention from the contracting agencies or the design-builders. Potential issues are often overlooked during the RFQ and RFP phases when agencies prepare contract documents, or when the design-builders develop their qualifications and proposals for these large civil projects. For example, in many large design-build projects, ITS is not even taken in account when the agencies evaluate the proposers¡¯ qualifications and proposals. As a result, the contracting agencies often face ITS-related contract change orders during contract execution as the potential issues emerge. In some cases, the operating agencies have to live with the consequences such as incompatibility between different systems, reduced equipment functions, or unsatisfied system performance upon completion of the projects when the systems are in operation.   Second, the formulation of the RFP especially the technical requirements is a significant effort and should not be underestimated by the contracting agencies. An important question is how to provide the flexibility and encourage design-builder¡¯s innovation. WSDOT invested significant efforts and time in developing the technical requirements which form an important part of the RFP documents.  It generally takes approximately six months to one year to develop the RFP documents for a large project.   Third, how to respond to the proposers¡¯ ATCs and questions often presents challenges to the contracting agencies. In many cases, the agency¡¯s responses to the ATCs are fast tracked, - 7 -  requiring timely processing by the agency to avoid impacts on the procurement schedule. Some ITS-related ATCs are technical in nature and may require extensive efforts to evaluate before the agency can respond. In some cases, the agency may need opinions from external resources. This brings the challenge to the agency¡¯s project manager on how to consult the external resources but still maintain the confidentiality and security of the on-going procurement. The agency¡¯s project manager will need to balance the need for specific expertise vs. the absolute need for confidentiality.    Finally, ITS design and implementation is often driven by the advancements of new technologies available on the market.  Because of its dynamic nature, change management after execution of a design-build contract is always one of the biggest challenges faced by the contracting agencies as well as the design-builders. These changes could be initiated by either the system owner or the design-builder by proposing new ITS technologies for the project. The agency¡¯s project manager will need to evaluate the benefits vs. the additional cost without comprising the overall project quality and schedule.        The following section describes how WSDOT used the Systems Engineering Process (SEP) in the ITS design-build process and further discusses how the SEP helped to deal with some of these challenges.  4.2 Use of Systems Engineering Process (SEP) in the ITS design-build Process   What is the Systems Engineering Process (SEP)? In 2001, the Final Rule on ITS Architecture and Standards Conformity and the Final Policy on Architecture and Standards Conformity were enacted by the FHWA and FTA respectively. The Final Rule/Final Policy requires that all ITS projects funded with highway trust funds use a systems engineering process for ITS project development.   The use of the system engineering process promotes upfront planning and system definition prior to technology selection and implementation. The system engineering process focuses on stakeholder needs, expectations, concept of operations, and the system requirements prior to the detailed system design and implementation. As a result, the use of SEP will reduce the risk of cost and schedule overruns, gain stakeholder participation and reduce the life cycle cost for long-term operations, maintenance, upgrade and expansion of the systems.   The bottom portion of Figure 3 illustrates the Vee diagram excerpt from the FHWA¡¯s ¡°Systems Engineering Guidebook for ITS¡± (reference 6), which provides an overview of the process in the system life cycle. The next section describes how to use the SEP in the ITS design-build process and to provide the flexibility and encourage design-builder¡¯s innovation during the design-build contracting.    Why is it important to use SEP in the ITS Design-Build Process? The use of SEP will provide flexibility in procurement of the ITS to minimize the use of proprietary products and to promote the use of industry standard interfaces. Most importantly, it provides the opportunities for the design-builder to develop an innovated design and construction methods without compromising the project quality.       The top portion of Figure 3 shows the typical design-build process in relation to the SEP and system life cycle time line. An ITS design-build contract usually consists of system design, development, and implementation. Based on the project needs, it sometimes includes concept - 8 -  of operations development and system definition at the beginning of the project, and warranty, operations, and maintenance after the system is built. WSDOT¡¯s current practices include ITS maintenance and warranty as typical contract provisions for design-build. It always a good practice to mandate the design-builder to follow the SEP in design and implementation of the ITS components of the project. WSDOT references the SEP in its Design Manual which is always included in a design-build RFP as a Mandatory Standard, and further define the specific ITS components in the RFP that requires the development of a systems engineering report or concept of operations in accordance with the SEP.   Figure 3 ¨C Systems Engineering Process in ITS Design-Build Process  It is worth noting that all aspects of the SEP should be carefully examined by the contracting agency during the RFP development to ensure that every step in the system development cycle is either completed during the project planning, or will be completed by the design-build contract. When one or more steps are missing, it often creates issues that are difficult to resolve after the design-build contract is executed.  For example, when a concept of operations and system requirements have not been developed because the contracting agency fails to include this work item in the RFP, it is very likely to cause lack of system functions, unsatisfied system performance, or incompatibility with external systems when the system is designed and constructed by the design-builder. Because the system definition is not identified up front, the design-builder is often reluctant to develop detailed system requirements or a concept of operations because they are not included in the contract. In this case, the contracting agencies always play ¡°catch-up¡± and will likely end up with negotiating change orders with the design-builder.

During this process, the design-builder may use an innovated design or construction method to develop a cost-effective solution, or use a different technology to meet the project needs. Therefore, this often creates a win-win situation for both the system owner and the design-builder.  5. A CASE STUDY OF SR 520 DESIGN-BUILD PROJECTS  5.1 Overview of the SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV Program   The SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV Program will enhance safety by replacing the aging floating bridge and keep the Seattle region moving with vital transit and roadway improvements throughout the 12.8-mile corridor between I-5 in Seattle and SR 202 in Redmond. The roadway improvements include the construction of new High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, median transit stops, reconfiguration of interchanges, addition of HOV direct access ramps, community enhancement lids, and pedestrian/bike path connections throughout the corridor. In March 2010, the Washington State Legislature approved tolling for the SR 520 floating bridge which allows the toll revenue to fund for the SR 520 corridor improvement and the floating bridge replacement projects under this program. These projects include all aspects of the ITS components as listed in Table 1.    As part of the SR 520 Floating Bridge Replacement and HOV Program, two design-build projects were awarded last year and are currently under design and construction, and one project is currently under design-build procurement and the ABV is expected to be announced in August, 2011. The three projects are: ¡þ Pontoon Construction Project, awarded in 2010 ¡þ Eastside Transit and HOV Project (Eastside), awarded in 2010 ¡þ Floating Bridge and Landings Project (FB/L), currently under procurement   Figure 4 illustrates the project areas for the SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV Program (reference 7).   Figure 4 ¨C SR 520 Bridge Replacement and HOV Program    Included in this section are the discussions on the RFP development and contract administration for the Eastside and FB/L design-build projects. The Pontoon Construction - 10 -  Project does not have ITS involved, and therefore is not discussed in this section. Also note that the SR 520 program includes the SR 520 roadways from I-5 to the new floating bridge as part of the SR 520/I-5 to Medina ¨C Bridge Replacement and HOV Project, but the project contracting method has not yet been determined.    5.2 What¡¯s included in the RFP?   The following items were included in the RFP¡¯s General Provisions and the Technical Requirements (references 8 & 9): ¡þ Liquidated Damages (General Provisions) ¡þ Scope of Work ¡þ Coordination with Adjoining Projects ¡þ Mandatory Standards ¡þ Modifications to the WSDOT Standards Special Provisions ¡þ Performance Requirements  o Design-Build Personnel Requirement  o Task Force Meetings o ITS Testing Requirements ¨C existing equipment testing, factory acceptance testing, shop testing, National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocols (NTCIP) acceptance testing, communication cables & interface equipment acceptance testing, ITS field equipment acceptance testing, system acceptance testing, and live traffic testing  o Maintenance and Operation o Removal and Delivery o Training  o Final Acceptance o Warranty ¡þ Design Requirements for all ITS subsystems including traffic data stations, ramp metering, CCTV traffic surveillance, ATM, Highway Advisory Radio (HAR), conduits, communication cables & interfaces, video and data distribution and transmission, weather sensors, floating bridge monitoring and alarm system, tunnel lighting control system, emergency traffic signals, communication hubs, traffic management center, and All Electronic Tolling (AET) system,   ¡þ Construction Requirements for all ITS subsystems including NTCIP and software requirements ¡þ Submittal Requirements including preliminary and final design packages, release for construction, shop drawings, and testing documentation.   5.3 Challenges in the RFP Development for ITS   The ITS system on the SR 520 corridor is complex and consists of various subsystems. Among these subsystems, there are traditional ITS devices such as CCTV cameras, HAR, traffic detectors, ramp meters, weather sensors, and fiber communication equipment, for which WSDOT has well established design guidelines and construction specifications that can be used in the design-build contract documents. However, there are also many subsystems such as floating bridge monitoring and alarm, tunnel lighting control, emergency traffic signals, ATM, and AET subsystems that utilize new technologies, but WSDOT has not yet developed best practices in design and implementation of these subsystems. During the RFP development, WSDOT approached to these subsystems differently by utilizing performance based requirements with a strong focus on the SEP, and advancing the conceptual plans to - 11 -  different design levels as needed. Provided below are some of the major challenges that WSDOT program managers and engineers faced when developing the RFP documents.           How to develop clear and concise Technical Requirements? In order to keep the Technical Requirement clear and concise, the RFP focused on developing performance based requirements (i.e. the end products) whenever possible, and avoided using prescriptive specifications unless there is better alternative.  In addition, in order to keep the RFP concise, the RFP includes the WSDOT Standard Special Provisions that are typically used for design-bid-build contracts as a separate contract document, but these special provisions were modified and tailored specifically to these design-build contracts.   What design levels are required prior to issuing the RFP? It depends. Perform a thorough risks/benefits analysis to determine whether risk elements assigned to the design-builder can be properly developed prior to issuance of the RFP. This is typically used to determine how far the preliminary design has to be carried (to address owner-held risk elements) before the RFP is released. The two SR 520 design-build projects provided 30% engineering plans as a reference document to the RFP. We feel this is the right design level for the conceptual plans. However, for some ITS components such as emergency traffic control system and tunnel lighting control system, we did not provide conceptual plans, but the RFP requires the design-builder to develop a systems engineering report and concept of operations prior to their preliminary design in accordance with the SEP.  How and when to use prescriptive specifications vs. performance based criteria? The efforts in developing a design-build RFP are specifically related to developing adequate performance criteria. The ideal design-build RFP would define end result criteria through narrative descriptions and performance based criteria, which, when met, would meet all of the owner¡¯s desired criteria while refraining from providing prescriptive measures on how to obtain this end. However, the prescriptive specifications are still very useful in some cases, for example, when defining the interfaces with existing systems.  How to require proprietary products in a design-build contract?  Every two years, WSDOT submits a list of proprietary ITS equipment and seeks approval from FHWA for using this equipment on WSDOT projects. The RFP was developed only to include the proprietary items that had already approved by FHWA. One exception is the ATM equipment. Because it is a newly developed system and WSDOT doesn¡¯t have standardized equipment, a request was submitted to FHWA for approval prior to the release of the RFP.    How to develop the requirements when the new ITS installed by the design-builder must interface with existing systems? Prescriptive specifications were used in this case to precisely define the interface requirements. There is not much ¡°wiggle room¡± for the design-builder when interfacing with existing systems.   How to handle the system or equipment that will be designed or installed by a third party? A good example is the All Electronic Toll (AET) System for the FB/L Design-Build Project. WSDOT is currently procuring toll equipment under a separate contract. However, the AET infrastructure must be provided by the FB/L project in order to facilitate the third party to install the toll equipment. Prescriptive specifications were used to define the interfaces between these two projects.   - 12 -  What should be included in the design-build contract if the other agency will operate and maintain the system after the project? The traffic signal systems under the Eastside design-build projects will be operated and maintained by a local jurisdiction. Prior to the RFP release, agreements were developed between WSDOT and the local jurisdiction for establishing some of the contract responsibilities, and operations and maintenance upon completion of the project.   How to define the end result criteria if the contracting agency is not familiar with the new system or equipment, or have no knowledge on the end products?    An example under the Eastside Project is the tunnel lighting and emergency traffic control systems. WSDOT requires the design-builder to develop a systems engineering report and concept of operations prior to their preliminary design in accordance with the SEP. In this case, the risks associated with the new system are transferred to the design-builder, but the system owner still has the opportunity to review the system development.     How to develop requirements that are compliant with industry standards?     The RFP requires that the design-builder use NTCIP 1213 in developing the tunnel lighting control system and provides the flexibility for the design-builder to choose appropriate NTCIP objects and functions to serve the needs identified in the systems engineering report and concept of operations.     Is ITS part of the Basic Configuration? ITS is an integral part of the large design-build projects, but we did not include ITS as part of the basic configurations. Because it is difficult to quantify the functional and performance measures of the ITS, we used performance based requirements to define the expected ¡°end¡± results.     Is Warranty required?  All ITS required a minimum of one year warranty upon Physical Completion of the project including both workmanship and equipment. Physical completion of the project is the completion date of the physical construction of the project and the design-builder meets all technical requirements of the project except for minor punch list items.   How are the quality control provisions developed in the RFP? In addition to the Quality Management required in the RFP, the ITS performance requirements specifically require a rigorous multi-level testing program that includes existing equipment testing, factory acceptance testing, shop testing, NTCIP acceptance testing, communication cables & interface equipment acceptance testing, ITS field equipment acceptance testing, system acceptance testing, and live traffic testing prior to the final acceptance.    5.4 Challenges in Contract Administration   After the selection of the design-builder and execution of the contract, the contracting agencies take on the role of contract administration.  Since a design-build contract transfers full responsibility to the design-builder, the design-builder is responsible for the project management, while the contracting agency focuses on the contract administration and compliance verification. The main challenge faced by the contracting agencies is how to ensure the quality of the project meets the contract requirements (compliance).  - 13 -  What level of oversight is sufficient from owner¡¯s perspective? WSDOT does not provide for at-risk construction. Design submittals for construction components must be at 100% design level prior to beginning construction. All work had to be reviewed by WSDOT oversight team prior to being released for construction. Even though the design-build contract is supposed to eliminate the knowledge gap between designer and contractor, a certain level of ¡°handholding¡± may be still necessary at the beginning of the contract if the design-builder is not familiar with the agency¡¯s design standards. However, too much oversight from the contracting agencies may not be efficient to run the design-build project since the design-builder is the Engineer-of-Record and is fully responsible for quality management of the project. The contracting agency¡¯s primary focus should be on the compliance verification, and leave the design-builder¡¯s project managers to manage the entire project.      How is compliance verification carried out during design and construction? WSDOT and the design-builder jointly form a Quality Assurance team on a design-build project. The focus of contracting agency¡¯s quality assurance program is on product compliance with contract documents, verification of the design-builder¡¯s quality control measures, and meeting Federal quality requirements. The design-builder is responsible for quality management in accordance with a quality management plan developed and approved by the contracting agency prior to beginning construction. For ITS and electrical systems, in addition to the design-builder¡¯s own QC/QA activities (inspection), WSDOT will also perform its own independent inspection per the State law.  6. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  This paper has described the two-phase design-build procurement process with a focus on ITS delivery as part of a large design-build transportation project.  Based on the WSDOT¡¯s current practices in ITS design-build, our key findings include: ¡þ When developing the RFP, allow ample time to produce a quality RFP with a strong focus on the technical requirements. In addition to the time spent for developing the 30% preliminary plans, it took approximately 6 months developing the RFP documents for each of the SR 520 design-build projects prior to the RFP release, and then, it took between three to six months for developing and releasing addenda. The entire procurement process including RFQ and RFP took about one year to complete.      ¡þ At beginning of the RFP development, WSDOT assembled a RFP development team consisting of both owner and consulting support staff employees in a co-located office, which greatly enhanced the communications across all disciplines. Further, WSDOT formed an expert review panel to review the contract documents prior to the RFP release. ¡þ The use of System Engineering Process (SEP) in the RFP development provided the flexibility in the ITS procurement process which encouraged design-builder¡¯s innovation, especially for the new systems and technologies.  ¡þ Whenever possible, WSDOT provided a clear and concise RFP as part of the contract documents using performance based criteria to define the end results rather than providing complex prescriptive specifications. However, it was also necessary to use prescriptive specifications when defining the interface with existing ITS systems.  ¡þ Whenever applicable, WSDOT mandated using the national standards such as NTCIP in system design and implementation.  - 14 -  ¡þ WSDOT began coordination with other stakeholders and local agencies at the beginning of the design-build procurement process. This provided enough time to develop inter-agency agreements prior to the release of RFP.  ¡þ In addition to the design-builder¡¯s QC/QA activities, WSDOT conducted independent inspection of the ITS/electrical systems which greatly enhanced the quality of the design-build projects.   In addition to these findings, we also offer the following recommendations for the contracting agencies to consider in their design-build procurement for ITS: ¡þ Decide carefully what to procure in a design-build contract based on a thorough risks/benefits analysis. For example, for a new system with many uncertainties or equipment that will be furnished and installed by a third party (such as the toll equipment), it may be better to procure this separately under a different contract.  ¡þ Depending on type of the projects or importance of the ITS in the project, consider adding ITS as part of the agency¡¯s evaluation criteria when scoring the technical proposal. This will encourage the shortlisters to provide innovative solutions for ITS implementation, especially for design and implementation of new systems.  ¡þ Focus on the project interfaces between different projects that typically follow different timelines. ¡þ Wherever possible, leave the design-builder to design what¡¯s inside the box, and develop performance criteria to promote design-builder¡¯s creativity and innovation. ¡þ Utilize experienced staff with knowledge and expertise in ITS design and implementation is critical to develop the technical requirements for the RFP.

©\1©\?©\ ?I-595 EXPRESS A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERING FOR ITS DEPLOYMENT, OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE  Juan Kuthy ITS Manager I 595 Express, LLC 10368 State Road 84, Suite 202, Davie, FL 33324 USA +1-954-513-3200 jkuthy@i595express.com  Public-Private Partnerships (3P) around the worl d are one of the m ost efficient mechanisms to design, build, operate and m aintain infrastructu re. The US has started  to em brace roadway  concessions as a way to not only maintain, but also to expand th e roadway infrastructure in the country. The Florida D epartment of Transporta tion signed a public-priva te partnership (P3) agreement with I-595 Express, LL C, to serve as the concessiona ire to design, build, finance, operate and  m aintain the roadway   inf rastructure in cluding reve rsible lanes  alon g the I-595  corridor for a long-term  commitment of 35 years. Part of this Concession Agreem ent includes the design, installation, maintenance and operation of a very complex Intelligent Transportation System for  the Interstate I- 595. This includes the design, in stallation and operation of a temporary traffic m anagement system to be utilized during the 5 year construction period, a Reversible Express Lanes Access Control System and the permanent traffic management system, altogether referred to as the ITS.   This paper describes the elem ents of the Inte rstate 595 IT S as well as som e experiences and challenges encountered during the first two years of the project. It will also provide lessons-learned to be applied for future similar project   Keywords: Public-Private Partnerships, Concessions, Managed Lanes, Reversible Lane  INTRODUCTION The I-595 project will consist of the addition of  three tolled express lanes along the m edian of the highway and the reconstruction and expansion of most of the interchanges, entrances and exit ramps as depicted in Figure 1. During the 5 year construction, the existing IT S originally installed in the highway  has to be removed and replaced with an Interim Traffic Managem ent System utilizing self-contained trailers with ITS equipment. The ITMS trailers are connected to the TMC via wireless and fiber point connections. I 595 Express, LLC is responsible not only for the deployment and maintenance of the ITMS system  but also for its oper ation from the shared FDOT District 4 TMC facility.  ©\2©\?©\ ?As part of the construction works a new permanent ITS will be installed to not only monitor and control the traffic flow on the general purpose la nes of I-595 but also to control and monitor the traffic on the Express Lanes and most im portantly to pro vide Acces s C ontrol to  the traf fic utilizing the express lanes. A separate com ponent of the ITS Syste m is the Em ergency Access Gates system to allow emergency vehicles to enter or exit safely from the Express Lanes during emergencies.   Figure 1. Project Layout INTERIM TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ITMS) Rapid deployment, reliability of the equipment and the ab ility to re-position trailers at sho rt notice were some of the most important requirements of the ITMS Sys tem. A total of  26 self-contained tr ailers with 5 wireless r epeater st ations installed on concrete poles com pose the ITMS. The trailers contain a combination of CCTV cameras, Microwave Detection Devices and Dynamic Message Signs powered by solar power and portable generators. All trailers are connected via a wireless system  along the road way with som e locations utilizing CDMS modems; at the project lim its two interconnection points are installed to connect the wireless system to the TMC via fiber optic cable.  Daily challenges are po sed to the installation a nd operation of the IT MS system, of which the most significant one is the active construction on the road. Selecti on of each one of the trailer sites was coordinated with each  one of the construction phase s not only to place the ITMS ©\3©\?©\ ?trailers in ar eas where c onstruction activities will not be disrupted, but also to ensure that the ITMS trailers can accomplish their functionalities of traffic monitoring and control.   A wireless communication system was chosen as the best way to interconnect the ITMS trailers and at the same time have the flexibility to relo cate the trailers along the road and maintain the communication connectivity. All IT MS trailers have self-contained power via solar panels and batteries and in some strategic location they include portable generators.  The operations of the ITMS system is perform ed 24/7 from the FDOT District 4 TMC where I 595 Express personnel that incl udes operators, a TMC m anager, IT and ITS Maintenance technicians are located.  The Concession agreem ent between FDOT and I 595 Express, LLC contains stringent requirements regarding ITS equipment and IT system availability on a quarterly basis to be of at  least 94%, as of today I 595 Express have maintained an equipment availability above 99%.  PERMANENT ITS There are two m ajor components to the perm anent ITS to be installed on I 595: the ¡°standard¡± ITS and the Express Lanes Access Control system.  The ¡°standard¡±  ITS deployment consists of CCTV cameras, Vehicle Detection Devices, Highway Advisory Radio, Dynamic Message Signs and the communication system. The purpose of this system is to monitor and control the traffic along the entire I-595 corridor including the Express Lanes.  The second system, the Express Lan es Access Control System (ECS) is required to contro l the entrance an d exit poin ts to the reversib le Express Lanes , and inclu des a m echanized and  automated Emergency Access Gate system . The Express Lanes will f unction as a  ¡°reversible system where during certain hours a day the lanes will carry traffic in one direction only and then reverse and carry traffic in the opposite direction. The m ain purpose of the Express Lanes is to augment the capacity of the road to carry traffic during ¡°peak¡± hours.  Safety is the premise of the operation of the Express Lanes, and consequently the Express Lanes Access Control System will be designed, installe d and operated on that founding principle. Th e system designer¡¯s f ocus is to ensur e that it will not only be safe but also reliable and easy to maintain.   Five entrances, two for eastbound traffic and th ree for westbound traffic will be the access  locations to the facility (Figure 2). Each one of these entranc es will be controlled via an Access Control Unit (ACU) where the following elements are connected.   ©\4©\?©\ ? Figure 2. Express Lanes Control System Locations  EXPRESS LANES COMPONENTS The purpose of the I-595 ITS System  and its components is to collect a nd transmit to the TMC, real-time data and live video from  field de vices located along the co rridor, enabling the TMC Operators to make traffic management decisions and allowing communication via the DMS¡¯s to the road users. Information transmitted between the field devices and the TMC will also be used to operate the reversible express lanes, and de ploy emergency and m otorist assistant services. The ITS System will also have a high level of automation, analyzing real-time traffic data, used to (a) prov ide travel time information to road  users and (b) m anage general purpose / express lane traffic and toll rates. Third party entities such as emergency responders will also have access to video from the corridor to enable monitoring and emergency planning.  In general the I-595 Project ITS co nsists of field devices that will be d eployed on the Express  Lanes (for purposes of managing the reversibility of traffic and provid ing access to emergency services at defined locations) and on the General Purpose Lanes (¡°no toll¡± eastbound and westbound lanes) for the purposes of m onitoring traffic, communicating to the road users and  collecting information to be used in the management of traffic congestion.   All ITS subsystems will be controlled from the I-595 Traffic Management Center (I-595 TMC). The I-595 TMC is located at District 4 SMA RT SunGuide TMC, at 2300 W . Co mmercial ©\5©\?©\ ?Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309. Space ha s been allocated to I-595 Express for the purposes of establishing its own dedicated TMC.  The following are the elem ents related to the sa fe operation of the reversible lanes (Express Lanes) following a Safe Management Access approach as shown on Figure 3:  Changeable Message Signs (CMS) and Lane Control Signals (LCS) A series of CMS boards and LCS will be insta lled at every entry point to the Express lanes. The purpose of the CMS¡¯s and LCS¡¯s is to provide the motorist with a visua l indication of whether  the Express Lanes are open or closed from the di rection of travel. T he system is placed in  advance of the expres s lane access p oints and is the first indication of the status of the express lanes (open  / clo sed), and will b e supported  by the exp ress lan e barrier system  which will provide a physical control point to the express lane.   Warning and Barrier Gates Each one of the entrances will consist of a series of Warning Gates (breakable) that provide a physical and visual deterrent to prevent the motorists entering the system in a ¡°closed¡± state. One Barrier Gate per entrance will pr ovide a non-intrusive barrier that will prevent any vehicle from entering the system in a ¡°closed ¡± state. The Entry Barrier S ystem is operated in s equence with the CMS and LCS as described below.  Figure 3. Safe Management of Access to the Express Lanes  Emergency Access Gates The Emergency Access Gates system is a unique element to the I 595 project in support of the Safety operation of the road. The purpose of th e Emergency Access Gates is to pro vide access for authorized emergency vehicles to the Express Lanes. The emergency access gates are located along the Interstate 595 at points designed to be as  proximate as possible to existing on-ramps to minimize emergency response times.  The Emergency Access Gates are supported by a shoulde r barrier protection system  to provide safer entry into the Express Lanes. This is achieved by protecting the shoulder at the EAG entry point through the opening of a light-weight barrier system in advance of the E AG opening, thereby warning the m otorists of merging vehicles. Another com ponent of the EAG system  are Approach?Express?LaneCMSOpen/ClosedLane?Use?SignalWarning?GatesBarrier?Gate©\6©\?©\ ?the flashing beacons s igns that are activated  when the EA G is openin g, to a lert drivers of the operation of the gates.   EXPRESS LANES OPERATIONS  The Express Lanes are  three lanes  that will b e used in the sam e direction when in use. The Express Lanes are located in the I-595 m edian between the eastbound and westbound general purpose lanes and have access to / from other neighborin g routes as well as from the I 595 general purpose lanes. The Express Lane direction of travel will be changed to coincide with the peak travel direction. In general, it is anticipated that the direction of traffic flow will be towards the east in the morning and towards the west in the evenings.   The Express Lanes will be used to allev iate the traffic on the I 595 general purpose lanes. The Express Lanes are considered premium lanes and the motorists will have to pay toll for their use. The toll cha rge is variable and will be a m echanism used to contro l congestion in the gene ral purpose lanes. The Express Lanes will be used in the direction of peak traffic flow and will add to the total highway capacity. As the express lane s are seen fore most as a traffic m anagement tool, the intent is no t necessarily to set the toll  rates so that the Express Lanes are optimized to provide a s pecific travel time level of service,  but rather to set th e toll ra tes so that th ere is general optimization of traffic along the I 595 corri dor. This means that the toll rates may be set to attract traffic to the Express Lanes to alleviate congestion in the general purpose lanes.  The following table (T able 1) indicates th e operating and routine m aintenance hours for the Express Lanes   OPERATING/ MAINTENANC E HOURS EASTBOUD DIRECTION WESTBOUND DIRECTION Mon-Fri 4:00 AM to 1:00 PM OPEN CLOSED Mon-Fri 2:00 PM to 2:00 AM CLOSED OPEN From Sat 4:00 AM till Mon 2:00 AM  OPEN CLOSE D Mon-Fri 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM (Routine Maintenance) CLOSED CLOSE D Table 1. Express Lanes Operating Schedule The schedule above can be configurable in order to allow the inclusion of special events. The Reversible Express Lanes (REL) system will trigger a schedule reminder for the user before the execution of an opening/ closing sequence begins.  ©\7©\?©\ ?The Express Lanes are used to modify the traffic behavior and to provide a source of congestion management for the Florida Department of Transportation. These two primary objectives may be in conflict, where the n eed to attract traffic into the Express Lanes to alleviate general purpose lane congestion (by reducing the toll charge ) may take precedence over m aximizing throughput (charging a toll r ate determined to m aximize revenue irr espective of the level of  traffic in the Express Lanes).  Precedence of use is categorized by order of the headings below:  Traffic Flow. The rate at which traffic is moving along the general purpose lanes (irrespective of perceived congestion) will determine the travel tim e level-of-service that the Department hopes to achieve. The traffic flow targ et is to be e xpressed as the m aximum travel time taken for the motorists to travel betw een defined points (¡°m onitored section¡±) along the I 595.  Intervention shall take place when the maximum travel time is exceeded for any m onitored section (or any defined combination thereof). Intervention shall be made by means of making the Express Lanes less costly to use thereby attracting the general purpose lane motorist.   Toll Collection The Toll Operations  Concept of Operati ons provides a detailed set of logical rules on which the travel times and associated toll collection commercial rules are based.  Traffic Management ¨C Emergencies in the Express Lane Corridor. For Level 3 accidents inside the express lanes (an even t that last longer than 120 minutes with all lanes blocked), the Concessionaire¡¯s O&M Manager may utilize the Express L anes Emergency Access Gates to alleviate the traffic cong estion inside the expres s lanes and divert traffi c to the general purpose lanes. ECS Operation. The Express Lanes Entry Control System (ECS) control sequence consists of automated, programmed logical instructions initiated through human actions on the SunGuide system, and purposeful human checks and triggers occurring in a designed sequence. The ECS module designed to function on the SunGuide platform will be operated from the Traffic Management Control center located at Commercial Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale.  Operation from TMC. The I-595 Express Lane system will be operated by I 595 Express, LLC (the Concessionaire) staff. The I-595 Express Lane control module will consist of an Express Lane Status Display Unit (ELSDU) which provides a graphical representation of the Express Lane entry and exit point equipment components and all the emergency access gates components on combined screens. Operation of the ECS system is through a point and click interface with information input screens that require keystroke input.  Emergency Access Gate System (EAG). The EAG¡¯s will be used by authorized emergency providers to respond to an incident in the Express Lanes, by approaching the incident from the direction of traffic flow on the Express Lanes, or in the event of a total blockage of the Express Lanes, by approaching the incident from the counter flow direction on the Express Lanes. The nature of incidents may include: accident in the Express Lanes, contamination spillage in the Express Lanes, evacuation of the Express Lanes when there is a total blockage preventing the ©\8©\?©\ ?movement of vehicles and utilizing the Express Lanes to station the fire fighting vehicle adjacent to an accident scene in the general purpose lanes   The following objectives and goals have been esta blished for the operations and maintenance of the I 595 Express Lanes:  Goal #1: Mobility and reliability.   Objective 1-1: To reduce travel tim e and variation in travel times (i.e. im prove predictability of the trip) experienced by travelers using the corridor, by providing the travelers with information that will allow them to use underutilized highway capacity and also avoid congestion caused by incidents or peak traffic.  Goal #2 : Corrido r Event and Incident Manag ement.  There will be  only m inor im pacts of  incidents on travel tim e throughout the corridor; both in the extent  of impact and duration; and that incident management will preserve the safety of the travelers throughout the corridor. Objective 2-1: To inform travelers of  incidents, the resulting impacts, and  available o ptions in order to encourage route and express lane choices.  Objective 2-2: To manage traffic around even ts through early notifica tion, communication and coordination among responders, and informed reactions.   Goal #3: Comprehensive Traveler Information delivery.  To provide travelers and transportation professionals with a ¡®comprehensive¡¯ view of the corridor and its operations through the delivery of timely, accurate, and reliable travel information and data exchange.  I-595 Express, LLC is responsible for both the operation of the TMC and the ITS devices placed along the corridor. I-595 Express,  LLC currently m anage three m onitoring consoles that are expressly designed to provide  command, control and comm unication for the I-595 corridor.  These stations are m anned 24 hours per day, 7 da ys per week throughout the year. All I-595 Express, LLC TMC operato rs co nform to the sa me qua lifications as those of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) TMC and are subject to the same policies and procedures regarding TMC operation. The shift schedule for ope rators is the same as for the other SMART SunGuide TMC operators in the Broward TMC Center. Since the I-595 Express, L LC TMC Operations are co-located with the FDOT and Broward County TMC operations, all parties must work together in one cohesive unit.  As suc h, I-595 Express, LLC TMC personnel is subject to and follows the sam e overall policies and proc edures of the SMART SunGuide TMC and use similar Standard Operating Procedures for operation of the I-595 ITS system . The  SMART SunGuide TMC has de veloped detailed Adm inistrative Policies and Procedures and Standard Operating Guidelines for Operations . These Sta ndard Operating Guidelines (SOGs) have been adapted for the I-595 Express, LLC TMC operation.   ©\9©\?©\ ?Currently, I 595 Express, LLC provide the f ollowing services as part  of the Concession Agreement:  Road Ranger The purpose of the Road Ranger program is to patrol the project on a scheduled basis. In general, the services provided by a Road Ranger include the following:  Assisting stranded motorists by clearing disabled vehicles from travel  lanes, changing flat tires, jump-starting batteries and providing lim ited am ounts of fluid such as gasoline and engine coolant;   Assisting stranded motorists to get help for towing or removal of their vehicle from the facility;  Assisting the Transportation Management Center with traffic and incident management to reduce traffic congestion and delays caused by vehicle breakdowns, collisions, and material spills; Providing assistance to law enforcem ent personnel when requested, including setting up MOT when required; and   Clearing, clean-up and debris removal either found on the travel way or from a collision. The Road Ranger service is provided on a c ontinuous basis on I-595, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, three hu ndred-sixty-five days per year, in cluding holidays and weekends. The Road Rangers drive routes in a loop (also called a beat/cycle ) during the day only stopping to clear debris/litter from the roadway, assist with incidents, and inspect the roadway on demand.  As part of the Expres s Lanes operation, the Road Rangers will p rovide support during th e opening/ closing sequences to detect any obstruc tions along the entrance/ exit ram ps, clear any disable vehicles and assure th e Reversible Lanes are clear before commencing any opening sequence. Severe Incident Response Vehicle (SIRV) To help m itigate the d elays caused by sever e traffic accidents and to  increase the safety of emergency responders, a severe incident response  vehicle program  has been established.  This SIRV program is intended to provide an immediat e presence at severe incidents such as those resulting in multiple lan e closures lasting longer than 30 minutes or full highway closure.  The  primary objective of the SIRV activ ity is to assist re sponding agencies in safely reopening the roadway as quickly as possible to meet the 90 minute goal of the Florida Open Roads Policy.   The SIRV is available 24/7 including weekends and holidays.  It is staffed by a designated I-595 Express, LLC O & M staff m ember who is certifi ed as a SIRV vehicle operator and incident manager.  The SIRV vehicle is stationed at the O & M office/yard complex located next to the I-595 roadway at Hiatus Road.  During norm al working hours, the designated SIR V operator for that shift is available to pick up the vehicle a nd advance to the scen e of the incident within ©\10©\?©\ ?several minutes.  After normal working hours, designated SIRV operators is on-call on a rotating basis in order to initiate a SIRV response with in 20 m inutes of being notified of the needed service.   When not in the field, designated SIRV oper ators are responsible for coordinating with responding agencies to conduct severe incident debriefings and prepare report summaries.  The Lead SIRV Operator also performs Quality of Service audits and vehicle inspections of the Road Ranger program and participates in the Brow ard County and South Florida Regional Traffic  Incident Management Meetings.  Rapid Incident Scene Clearance (RISC) I-595 Express, LLC use one or m ore dedicated specialty subcontractors to provide the Rapid Incident Scene Clearance (RISC) service.  This service focuses on the clearance of large vehicles such as trucks and sem i-tractor trailers that ha ve been involved in an incident and are blocking lanes or otherwise affecting traffic flow through the I-595 Express, LLC corridor.  Towing regulations for heavy-duty wreckers cu rrently used in Florida were develo ped decades ago. Heavy trucks hauling larger  loads now require specialized equipment and skilled operators to quickly remove them after an incident. This service provides an incen tive to clear wreckage  and open roads as quickly as possible.   In addition, any com plex or extended incident where vehicles cannot be easily towed from  the scene or are creating a hazard to traffic m ay be candidates for using  the RISC services, as directed by the I-595 Express LLC Operations Supervisor or Operations Manager.  Traveler Information Services I-595 Express, LLC provides real-time traffic, incidents and travel time information to the different Traveler Information Services provided by FDOT such as 511, District 4 SMART SunGuide and Interagency Video and Events Data Distribution System (IVEDDS), FDOT Sunguide as well as its own web page www.i595express.com.   ITS MAINTENANCE The safe operation of the Express Lane System  requires that all its com ponents perform in a  coordinated, seam less and fail- proof m anner. This is only achieved if good and proactive maintenance measures are taken. A dedicated gr oup of technicians and e ngineers work 24/7 to achieve equipment availability of at least 94% for ITS equipment and 99% for the IT System.   A m inimum of 2 ITS technicians are always av ailable to perform preventive and reactive maintenance on the ITS  Equipment, support IT  personnel is available to provide maintenance ©\11©\?©\ ?and troubleshoot services on the computers, network and communications equipment installed at the TMC.   A state-of-the-art fiber locate system will be installed for the purpose of minimize damages and disruptions to the fiber optic communication network. Redundant communication links will be available as well to maintain connectivity to all ITS Devices.  The electrical power system will be supplemented by an auxiliary power subsystem composed of a series of generators and Uninterrupted Powe r Supply (UPS) units to provide backup power to each one of the ITS devices installed.  The Concession Agreement dictates several performance measures related to the operations and maintenance of the I-595 Express to be follo wed by the Concessionaire. These perform ance measures in all cases carry a he fty penalty both m onetary and under a system of points in case the performance is not achieve as expected.    CONCLUSIONS Public-Private Partnerships in highway transportation projects are gaining momentum in the US as an efficient contractual mechanism that contains multiple benefits for the private industry, the government and the public. Incorporating ITS into  the 3P projects add trem endous value for a relatively minimum percentage of the overall project cost.   Different ITS components and operation procedures  such as the ones disc ussed on this paper increase the safety to the user, the perf ormance on the flo w of traffic and in con sequence add more ¡°value¡± to the customer using the facility.  For I 595 Express, the ITS system is adding value to the user by providing the following: - A Safer road  due to the early dete ction of incidents and disable vehicles allowing the  expedite dispatch of proper and trained personnel and equipment - A reliable road that provides consistent traffic flow  with m inimal disruptions due to incidents - An informed road that provides the user ev en before leaving home real-time traffic and roadway conditions and maintains the user informed during its transit thru the corridor. It is proven that 3P projects around the worl d are m aking possible even with the current economic conditions to bring highway infrastructure projects to completion and operation. ITS will most definitely benefit by being part of any future 3P projects. 
- 1-  THE SWEDISH TRANSPORT ADMINISTRATION (TRAFIKVERKET) ITS ACTION PLAN FOR THE RAIL SECTOR  TOPIC 1.A. ITS POLICY  Mr. Mats Lindqvist Senior Advisor and Project manager, Triona AB Box 762, 781 27 Borl?nge, Sweden +46 730 47 27 36 (tel), mats.lindqvist@triona.se  Mr. G?ran Ersk¨¦rs Senior Advisor and Project Manager, The Swedish Transport Administration  Kyrkogatan 4 801 02 G?vle, Sweden +46 243 44 50 00 (tel), goran.erskers@trafikverket.se   ABSTRACT  ITS was via the work with ITS World Congress in Stockholm 2009 established as an issue in the Swedish rail sector, even if the Swedish rail sector has been working with intelligent transport systems for a long time without calling it ITS. Right after the ITS World Congress in Stockholm 2009 the Swedish Rail Administration (since April 1 2010 a part of the Swedish Transport Administration) started to interview rail sector actors (train operating companies passenger and freight, infrastructure management, train management, logistics companies, public transport companies, freight transport buyers), about their needs and demands from a business perspective regarding data/information/IT-solutions, i.e. ITS, provided by the Swedish Rail Administration. During 2010 the work has continued with analyzing the current and planned situation within the Swedish Transport Administration. The actors needs have then been compared with the current and planned situation at the Swedish Transport Administration to find the gaps to be filled. June 2011 the action plan was decided. It will be presented to the rail actors late August 2011.   The paper describes the work that has been done to establish the action plan, examples of actual work within the action plan that has been done so far or work that is planned to be done.    Key words: Freight, Passenger, Public, Rail, Positioning, Disturbances, Planning, Standardization, Information, RFID   THE WORK TO CREATE THE ACTION PLAN     The Swedish Rail Administration (since April 1 2010 a part of the Swedish Transport Administration) interviewed 38 (43 asked) companies/organizations during November and December 2009. The companies represented the whole rail sector; train operating companies, passenger and freight, infrastructure management companies, train management companies, logistics companies, public transport companies and freight transport buyers. The interviewed were to consider the need for data and information exchange between themselves, the Swedish Rail Administration and other actors within the rail sector and in other modes.  - 2-   The goal of the needs analysis was to understand better how the Swedish Rail Administration   through improved data and information exchange could help increase the actor¡¯s commercial advantage and business development. Therefore often the actors CEO participated at the interviews. The actor¡¯s needs were an important instrument for the internal prioritization within the Swedish Rail Administration.  A comprehensive and good material was collected. Based on the interviews were formulated a number of conclusions. The conclusions were then discussed with the companies/organizations at a meeting January 2010. After the meeting the conclusions were slightly revised and then found the basis for a draft plan adopted by the Swedish Rail Administration.  In the work done 2009 was captured the actors needs and demands. In 2010, a number of studies were carried out to capture the current situation and planned actions at the Swedish Transport Administration (since April 1, 2010, the Swedish Rail Administration is a part of the Swedish Transport Administration) with the actors needs and demands as a basis.  The actors needs and demands have then been compared with the current and planned situation at the Swedish Transport Administration to find the gaps to be filled. Recommendations and suggestions for activities that eliminate the gaps and clarify dependencies have been developed.  June 2011 the action plan was decided. It will be presented to the rail actors late August 2011.    THE ACTION PLAN, AN OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT AND DECIDED ACTIONS   Clearly defined standardized data/information/IT-services  The Swedish Transport Administration must provide a basic service of clearly defined standardized data/information/IT-services. A basic service should be offered to all actors. Depending on the customer benefits, the actors expressed that it could also be OK to pay extra for certain data/information/packaged information/services beyond the basic services. The actors also have stressed that the Swedish Transport Administration must ensure that the quality, both concerning content and availability, are fulfilled according to service level agreements. Similarly, it was stressed that the Swedish Transport Administration must ensure that data does not fall into the wrong hands (privacy).  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall provide a basic service of clearly defined standardized data/information/IT-services. A basic service shall be offered to all type of actors.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall decide if, and if so, what extra data/information/packaged information/services beyond the basic services to provide and to what actors. The Swedish Transport Administration also shall decide if some of these services are to be payed for by the actors and if so, if the legal basis for being able to do so need to be revised.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall clarify the borderline between what they shall do and what other actors/service providers shall do within the field. That is necessary for being - 3-  able to create a market where actors/service providers can invest in creating services and being sure that The Swedish Transport Administration with governmental funding not does the same thing.   The Swedish Transport Administration shall clarify how the new law regarding public transport will affect the Swedish Transport Administration.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall establish SLA (Service Level Agreement) concerning any data / information exchange with external actors. The SLA:s shall be synchronized the with the internal agreements (eg service owner <-> system owner <-> ICT-services) so that external agreements can be fulfilled as promised.  Technical platform for information exchange  The Swedish Transport Administration must provide a technical platform for sending and receiving data/information. The actors want it to be easy to exchange data/information, whether by automated computer - computer solutions or if it is done computer - human. A platform for achieving this is therefore a basic requirement for all IT-based communication between the Swedish Transport Administration and the actors and thus one of the main priorities. The concept of platform can be interpreted and used in many ways, it must therefore be made clear what the Swedish Transport Administration mean by the term.  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall create a technical platform for the exchange of data/information which can be used by multiple services, whatever data / information to be exchanged. This means that not every system/project needs to create its own technological platform for information exchange.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall within the Transport Administration clarify roles and allocate responsibilities relating to work with information platform/s.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall coordinate the management of information services and the development and management of the technical platform for information exchange.  Compiled and packaged information  The Swedish Transport Administration should provide compiled and packaged information about the infrastructure (e.g. tracks, terminals, ports, stations, workshops), for every given point of time, in the past, present and in the future. The actors need the information to, for instance, be able to plan new traffic arrangements, be able to rearrange traffic and be able to evaluate traffic. Therefore it is very important that the whole transport system, and information about how it is linked, is documented so that actors can plan and see the whole transport/journey.  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall in collaboration with other actors continue the work with the Swedish portal for geodata. The portal is an infrastructure to improve and - 4-  facilitate access to geodata. It will function roughly like a ¡°cloud¡± of geodata and geodata services accessible via the Internet.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall continue the work with modernization of, and increase the quality of data within, the database describing the Swedish railway infrastructure.  A more effective planning process  The Swedish Transport Administration must provide tools for a more effective planning process (both for short and long term planning, special transports and infrastructure management). A way to accomplish this is to enable for the actors to interactively in the Swedish Transport Administration systems see what opportunities and conditions there are and will be in every given point of time in the future. It would also improve the actor¡¯s efficiency if the Swedish Transport Administration provides a system solution for the calculation of track access charges.  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall make sure the time table planning systems can interact with the infrastructure database.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall see to that the time table planning system can meet the demands of the train operating companies.   The Swedish Transport Administration shall to the train operating companies provide a system solution for calculating track access charges.  Information solutions for train drivers and other crew members  Information solutions for communication with train drivers and other crew members are crucial. Some operators use their own solutions. Other operators are interested in a more standardized approach to this, both in terms of information content and technical solutions.  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall define the strategic goals and describe the conceptual solution.   The Swedish Transport Administration shall establish cooperation with external actors.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall improve the possibilities for high speed communication at the stations enabling sending and collecting data.  Passenger information in languages other than Swedish  Passenger information, both via speakers and via signs, is needed in languages other than Swedish, primarily in English.   Decided actions:  - 5-  The Swedish Transport Administration shall cooperate with the actors to define the future actions needed when developing the current solutions.  Real time positioning  Real time geographical positioning of locomotives and wagons via e.g. GPS and/or RFID in combination with the traditional rail positioning systems is important for the actors.  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall via better real time positioning make rail transport more attractive from a logistical perspective.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall via better positioning create conditions to improve vehicle maintenance.  The Swedish Transport Administration shall via better positioning combined with detector information improve the maintenance of the infrastructure.   The Swedish Transport Administration shall pay for and be responsible for the deployment of RFID sensors in the infrastructure.   The Swedish Transport Administration shall define Swedish Transport Administration services based on RFID data.   The Swedish Transport Administration shall work with the introduction of RFID standard ISO 18000-6C in governing Technical Specifications for Interoperability.  Disturbance management  The Swedish Transport Administration must provide accurate, timely and detailed information about disturbances in the railway infrastructure and traffic that will affect and/or have affected the ability for the actors to deliver their services.  Decided actions:  The Swedish Transport Administration shall continue the started work within the field, i.e. improving processes, routines and IT-services.  Dialogue with the actors in the rail sector  The rail traffic can not work without well functioning ITS/ICT. All actors within the rail business are strongly depending on what that the Swedish Transport Administration is doing in the ITS/ICT area. Therefore it is very important for the future development of the rail sector that the Swedish Transport Administration establish and maintain an effective dialogue with the actors in the rail sector about ICT. The Swedish Transport Administration need to be proactive and work in close cooperation with the actors when deciding what ITS/ICT-solutions to create.  Decided actions: - 6-   Establish and maintain an effective dialogue with the actors in the rail sector about ICT.  MANAGEMENT OF THE ACTION PLAN  The action plan will from mid 2011 be managed by a programme committee that has an overall responsibility for all projects/activities. The projects/activities will though be funded and managed within their own respectively part of the Swedish Transport Administration. The programme manager and contact will be Mr. Lars G?ran Bernland at The Swedish Transport Administration.  
EXECUTION OF A FIELD OPERATIONAL TEST WITHIN THE EUROFOT PROJECT AT THE GERMAN1 TEST SITE  Mohamed Benmimoun Institut f¨¹r Kraftfahrzeuge, RWTH Aachen University (IKA) Steinbachstr. 7, 52074 Aachen mbenmimoun@ika.rwth-aachen.de  Dr. Adrian Zlocki Institut f¨¹r Kraftfahrzeuge, RWTH Aachen University (IKA) Aria Etemad & Dr. Christoph Kessler Ford Research & Advanced Engineering Europe Walter Hagleitner ADAS_Management-Consulting Dr. Marian Andrzej Obojski Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft Walter Schwertberger MAN Truck & Bus AG ABSTRACT The euroFOT project is the first large-scale Field Operational Test (FOT) of multiple Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in Europe. It will evaluate the impact of ADAS on safety, traffic efficiency, environment, driver behavior and user-acceptance in real life situations with normal drivers by means of collected data from instrumented vehicles. By offering valuable information for the short- and long-term impact of ADAS the euroFOT project aims to encourage the deployment of ADAS. Altogether, about 1000 vehicles equipped with different ADAS technologies take part in the field operational test. The FOT is coordinated by five Vehicle Management Centers (VMC) and carried out at various operation sites across six European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and United Kingdom). Within this paper the approach for conducting a field operational test for assessing the impact of ADAS at the German1-VMC and selected first results are presented. INTRODUCTION Today road transport in Europe faces enormous challenges caused by economical and social changes in the last years. These lead to new demands for each individual as well as for the entire economy. The individual demand for personal mobility and flexibility is increasing in Europe as it has already been over the last ten years. Studies show that the number of vehicles has grown from around 400 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in 1995 to 480 in 2005 within the EU25, which caused a higher traffic density (1). This growing number of vehicles is accompanied by an increased driver workload, due to increased traffic complexity and driving tasks, which results in a higher accident risk. In order to support drivers and to make driving safer, more comfortable and efficient with respect to environment and traffic flow advanced driver assistance systems have been developed. Their potential to provide a positive impact on traffic safety and efficiency is partly recognized (2).  Over the past years Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) and the Electronic Stability Program (ESP) as well as passive safety systems, e.g. safety belt or airbag, caused a significant reduction of accidents with injuries and especially of traffic fatalities. However, there are still 35000 fatalities on European roads every year. Hence the European Commission (EC) has announced in the 2001 White Paper on transport the objective of halving the number of fatalities on European roads until 2010 (3).  Started within the seventh framework programme of the EC, the euroFOT project establishes a comprehensive, technical and socio/economic assessment programme for evaluating the impact of ADAS on safety, traffic efficiency, environment and user-acceptance in real life situations. By means of instrumented vehicles data is collected and evaluated within the field operational test, in order to answer the pre-defined research questions.  GERMAN1-VMC The fleet of the euroFOT project is coordinated by five vehicle management centers (French, German1, German2, Italian and Swedish) across several European countries. This paper focuses on the approach defined for the German1-VMC. Here a fleet of 200 vehicles is managed, which consists of 60 trucks from MAN, 100 passenger cars from Ford and 40 passenger cars from VW. The data acquisition and processing as well as data storage processes for collected data from these 200 instrumented FOT vehicles are defined and implemented by the Institut f¨¹r Kraftfahrzeuge of the RWTH Aachen University (ika). The field operational test is conducted for a period of 12 months. The tested ADAS functions cover Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Curve Speed Warning (CSW).  All 200 vehicles are equipped with Data Acquisition Systems (DAS), which allow recording and temporary storage of all relevant measured values as well as the transfer of previously recorded data to a central storage server. The estimated amount of data at the German1-VMC adds up to approximately 6 TB, considering a duration of one year for the field test. The following figure provides an overview of the German1-VMC.

Tested ADAS functions and fleet composition at the German1-VMC As a result of this huge amount of data a detailed analysis of the complete data within the planned period of time is not feasible. Hence a limitation of the evaluation to relevant driving events is necessary, in which the particular tested functions have an influence (e.g. car following, lane change manoeuvres, critical distance situations (incidents) etc.). These events are extracted from the collected data by an automated process which has been developed at ika. The event recognition algorithm automatically detects certain patterns (combinations of different measures) in the CAN- and GPS-data. Although this approach demands high computational performance, it enables saving considerable amounts of time compared to manual processing of the large amount of data. In the following the methodology, the data processing chain as well as the automated event recognition processes are presented. METHODOLOGY The relevant data to be collected within the field test has been derived from the research questions of the project. Based on these research questions (assessment of the impact of ADAS on traffic safety, traffic efficiency, environment as well as driver behavior and acceptance) hypotheses to be tested (e.g. ¡þACC decreases the number of incidents¡°) have been defined. By means of the hypotheses the required signals and data sources have been identified. The definition process applied for the euroFOT project is presented in Figure 2.  Depending on the vehicles used, the available signals can vary between the different vehicle types and the VMCs. Moreover the vehicle types and instrumentations are not the same at all VMCs. Some of the VMCs collect only CAN-data, while others additionally collect video data, eye glance information etc..   Figure 2. Definition process of required signals For each operation site an adapted experimental design has been defined, in order to consider the specific basic conditions. In general the experimental design consists of a baseline (system-off period) as well as a treatment period (system-on period). At the German1-VMC the first three months of the field operational test will serve as a baseline period during which the ADAS functions will be deactivated, while data on driving performance (e.g. vehicle speed, acceleration) is collected. During the following treatment period, the functions to be tested will be activated and the recording of the same driving data will be continued. Comparisons between recorded driving behaviour and performance data for the same participant in the baseline and treatment periods will be made, in order to assess the impact of the functions. As an example the figure below presents the experimental design for 60 trucks at the German1-VMC.   Figure 3. Experimental design for the fleet of 60 trucks at MAN The trucks are equipped with ACC and LDW and are divided into two fleets. After the three month baseline period (A1) the functions will be tested separately at first. 30 trucks will have only ACC available while for the other 30 trucks only LDW is available. In the second treatment period (B2) both functions will be activated and available for the drivers. By means of comparisons between relevant data sets for the same participants in the first treatment (B1) and second period (B2) the impact of the combination of functions (ACC and LDW) will be assessed. Both tested functions will be deactivated within the second baseline period (A2), in order to assess potential learning effects by comparison with baseline period (A1), due to seven month treatment period (4). During the whole experimental phase data is collected from the instrumented vehicles. For the German1-VMC it has been decided to continuously record the required signals with defined sampling rates instead of collecting data only after detection of a relevant situation. Thereby some remarkable disadvantages can be avoided. One of the main disadvantages of a discontinuous recording of the data is a loss of possibly relevant data because of a not well-suited event recognition (e.g. wrong thresholds). The detection cannot be adapted at a later stage, if relevant raw data has not been collected. At the German1-VMC the signals are recorded permanently and event recognition is applied afterwards ¡°offline¡± within a server-side process. The availability of the complete raw data allows reprocessing of information after implementing any desired adaptations. However, the high amount of data that is generated compared to the situation-based approach results in higher demands on the data management. DATA MANAGEMENT For data collection in the field, the German1-VMC has equipped in total 200 vehicles with data acquisition systems (DAS). These DAS will collect data from up to four CAN-buses of the vehicles and additionally GPS-information. Other signal sources on vehicles side are not used at the German1-VMC, in order to ease the integration of the DAS into the vehicles compared to other scenarios such as integration of additional sensor equipment (e.g. video sensors).  The data measured on the connected CAN-channels will be stored in a first stage on a FLASH storage device installed on the DAS. The DAS at the German1-VMC offers the possibility to communicate with the device during operational time of the field test using an integrated GPRS module. This allows wireless uploading of recorded information to a centralized server system, while the DAS is collecting data simultaneously. Therefore the data is compressed and encrypted. By means of a GPRS connection the DAS status and operation on board of the vehicle can also be checked and monitored during the entire operation time. Figure 4 presents an overview of the process stages of the German1-VMC approach.  GPSGPRSServer systemData processingDatabaseData analysisResultsData uploadData acquisitionData storage and analysis  Figure 4. Data acquisition and processing at the German1-VMC These stages are data acquisition, pre- and post-processing of data, storage and analysis of data. After the data has been uploaded to the server, further processing steps are conducted. Within these processing steps the data will be enriched with additional attributes from a digital map (e.g. road type, speed limit), which are derived by means of GPS-information. Afterwards all necessary signals for the detection of relevant events and situational variables are available. Finally the processed data as well as the initially recorded data is stored on a server. Here the raw data is stored in files on a per-trip basis (i.e. for each trip one data file is recorded) as a backup for the case that a re-processing of certain data sets will be necessary. The processed data is filled in tables of an SQL-server. Data on the SQL-server will serve as basis for the evaluation.  The upload procedures are designed and implemented to work fully autonomously. Autonomous operation means that no user interaction ¨C neither on the driver side nor on the operator side ¨C is required. Hence the drivers are totally kept out of the data retrieval loop. No training of the drivers participating in the field test is needed and the loss of data due to maloperation is excluded. Besides the event recognition and data retrieval steps the entire process chain for data management has been automated (5). Figure 5 presents the structure of the software architecture that has been developed at ika for this purpose.   Figure 5. Software architecture of data management process at the German1-VMC The architecture for data management on the server side consists of several different software components. The coordination of the interaction between the software components is performed by the Central Management System (CMS). After data has been successfully uploaded on the server, the CMS is responsible for passing the data to the Data Manager, which subsequently manages the data processing. Data is passed between these software elements each time one process step is accomplished. The processing contains the conversion of the data to a standardized file format, the quality check and plausibility analysis as well as the enrichment and classification processes. The processed data is stored on an SQL based server at the end, in order to make the data available for the analysis. For configuration management and diagnostic purposes as well as operator access, additional software components (e.g. diagnostic processor etc.) complete the infrastructure for the automation of the whole process chain. DATA PROCESSING All data files collected by the DAS are on a per-trip basis. This means that the recording is started as soon as the vehicle¡¯s engine is started and is completed at the latest one hour after the vehicle¡¯s engine has been switched off. The follow-up time is applied, in order to provide additional time for data upload, which might have been not possible during the trip. If all collected data has been uploaded to the server during the trip, the DAS will be deactivated directly after the engine has been switched off.  The data files are directly passed to the processing chain by the CMS as soon as an entire recording file is available on the server side. The pre-processing is designed to work on a per-trip basis, while the post-processing (on SQL-database) will build a more complete overview. The pre-processing of data can be subdivided into two main process steps:  ¡þ Generation of processed and derived data (needed for hypotheses testing).  ¡þ Quality analysis, in order to ensure reliance of the analysis.   These two processing steps are split into two software components with a similar processing structure. The Plausibility and Check Manager is responsible for analyzing the usability of signals. Thereby the main functionality is realized by several extensions, each responsible for a specific aspect of data quality analysis. Checks for missing data and check for signal ranges are considered together with wrong dynamic behaviour and incoherent behaviour of signals. The data quality checks are performed directly after the upload and after each modification of the data. In the next processing step the available signals are used to detect relevant events as well as situational variables, in order to classify the data for focusing the analysis on relevant data sets. Furthermore the performance indicators (PI) needed for testing of hypotheses (e.g. time headway, time to collision etc.) are calculated. For the whole process additional information is needed, which is derived from the existing signals (GPS and vehicle dynamics) by using attributes from digital maps (e.g. road type, number of lanes etc.). These processes are conducted by the Event, Enrichment and PI Manager (6). Each function (event recognition, PI calculation etc.) is realized as a separate extension of this software element.  After the data has been processed it will be uploaded onto a database. The processed data stored on the database will be used for data analysis purposes. This data includes objective data from the vehicle CAN-busses as well as subjective information collected by means of time based questionnaires. In the following first results based on the initial analysis of the questionnaires received for 97 Ford drivers are presented. The final results of the objective as well as subjective data will be available by spring 2012. FIRST RESULTS The FOT at the German1-VMC started for Ford and VW in June 2010. For MAN the FOT started some months later. Since then approximately 2.6 million kilometres have been driven and more than 200.000 trips have been conducted.  In the following the kilometres driven by the Ford drivers divided into baseline and treatment phase are presented in the figure below. The ramp-up phase started in May 2010 for the first vehicles. In August 2010 the baseline (3 months) has been accomplished and the following treatment phase started. Altogether 1.6 million kilometres have been driven by the 100 Ford vehicles in the period May 2010 till May 2011. The FOT will be accomplished for all Ford vehicles in September 2011. 04000080000120000160000Mai 10 Jun 10 Jul 10 Aug 10 Sep 10 Okt 10 Nov 10 Dez 10 Jan 11 Feb 11 Mrz 11 Apr 11 Mai 11Driven Kilometres [km]Baseline (Sytem-off period)Treatment (System-on period) Figure 6. Driven kilometres by Ford drivers (n=100: May 2010 ¨C May 2011) Within this time period approximately 2 TB of vehicle data has been collected (only Ford drivers). Furthermore several time based questionnaires (7) have been collected. The first questionnaire (T1) is filled out at the beginning of the FOT. The second questionnaire (T2) is provided at the end of the baseline phase. Within the treatment period a questionnaire (T3) is provided after 3 months driving with the systems and a second questionnaire (T4) at the end of the system-on phase. In the following first results of the questionnaire analysis are presented. Altogether 97 T1-questionnaires for the Ford drivers have been received and evaluated. The T1-questionnaires contain questions on driving patterns and experience with the tested functions. The figure below presents the estimated percentage of their road type usage by the participants.  23%19%20%23%15%How often do you drive on:HighwayRural roadsTownFamiliar roadsUnfamiliar roads Figure 7. Estimated distribution of road type usage (T1; n=97) On average the drivers estimate to drive 23% on motorways, 19% on rural roads and 20% on urban areas. Furthermore the estimated percentage for driving on familiar roads adds up to 23% (unfamiliar roads 20%). The high percentage of motorway and rural road usage is very positive, because these road types represent the areas where the tested functions are designed to be used (e.g. ACC). For the analysis it is of importance to have an indication to what extent the participants are experienced with the tested functions. Thus the drivers have been asked in the T1-questionnaire on their experience with the tested functions as well as with other automotive technologies. A comparison between the experience with navigation systems, ACC, FCW and LDW is presented in Figure 8. 0102030405060708090100None, never heard of it I'm aware of the system, but never used itSome, brief experience Extended experienceExperience [%]ACCLDWFCWNavigation system Figure 8. Experience with navigation systems, ACC, FCW and LDW (T1; n=97) A high percentage indicated extended experience for navigation systems (81%), ACC (68%) and FCW (37%). In contrast only 3% of the drivers indicate to have extended experience with the LDW. The low experience with LDW can be explained by the fact that the LDW was not available in Ford vehicles at the time the FOT started. In the T3-questionnaire (after 3 months driving with systems) questions on workload as well as acceptance (8) are asked. In the following the feedback with respect to acceptance is presented. At the moment 48 T3-questionnaires have been received and evaluated. Acceptance is evaluated in euroFOT by means of several indicators. As indicators usefulness, pleasantness, goodness etc. are asked. The scale for these indicators ranges from ¡°-2¡± (very negative) to ¡°+2¡± (very positive) (9). The average for the different acceptance indicators is presented in the figures below.  -2,0-1,5-1,0-0,50,00,51,01,52,0Useful -UselessPleasant -UnpleasantGood -BadNice -AnnoyingNecessary -SuperfluousLikeable -IrritatingAssisting -WorthlessDesirable -UndesirableAverage [-]ACCFCW Figure 9. Acceptance indicators for acceptance evaluation (T3, n=48) On average no negative feedback for any of the indicators has been indicated by the Ford drivers for ACC as well as FCW. In general the acceptance for ACC is rated higher than for FCW. High acceptance values (>1.5) are indicated for usefulness, pleasantness, assistance and desirableness. Only for the indicator necessity the drivers indicate a higher acceptance for the FCW. Figure 10 presents the feedback for further acceptance indicators. For these indicators the response of the driver is positive.  -2,0-1,5-1,0-0,50,00,51,01,52,0Raising alertness -Sleep-inducingEffective -IneffectiveRaises confidence -Creates uncertaintySimple -ComplicatedSatisfying -UnsatisfyingTrustworthy -UntrustworthyIntuitive -UnintuitiveAverage [-]ACCFCW Figure 10. Acceptance indicators for acceptance evaluation (T3, n=48) High positive acceptance values (>1.0) are indicated for effectiveness, satisfaction and simpleness. The FCW is rated to be more intuitive and alertness raising than ACC. It is also noticeable that for ACC and FCW the indicator ¡°raising alertness ¨C sleep-inducing¡± is rated significantly lower compared with the other indicators.

Acceptance indicators for acceptance evaluation (T3, n=48) Altogether the first evaluation of the questionnaires shows a positive response feedback and in particular a positive acceptance rate for the ACC and the FCW.  Moreover the first evaluation of the objective data indicates a positive effect of the tested functions as well. The evaluation shows that the number of critical situations while driving with FCW is reduced by approximately 30%, which indicates a lower accident risk (accidents in longitudinal traffic ¨C same direction) when driving with the FCW. Within the next months the analysis of the objective as well as subjective data will be intensified, in order to have the needed information available to assess the benefit of the tested functions. SUMMARY & OUTLOOK In this paper the approach for conducting a field operational test at the German1-VMC within the euroFOT project has been presented. Especially the methodology as well as the developed data management processes for data upload, processing and storage have been introduced. Furthermore the challenges faced during the implementation phase for data processing (e.g. event recognition, harmonization of different signal outputs etc.) are exemplified.  Moreover first results of the questionnaire analysis for 97 Ford drivers have been presented. The results show that the acceptance for the ACC and FCW is rated very positive. In total no acceptance indicator is rated negative. The analysis of the available objective data shows that the accident risk while driving with FCW is reduced by approximately 30%. Currently the final data processing activities are conducted and first data uploaded onto the databases for analysis. Within the next months the hypothesis testing as well as the impact assessment on safety, traffic efficiency and environment will be started. The final results of the project will be available by spring 2012. REFERENCES (1) European Environment Agency (2007): ¡°Report 1/2008: Climate for a transport change¡±. ISSN 1725-9177.

-1- PERFORMANCE TESTING OF ACTIVE SAFETY  IN ROAD VEHICLES  Micha Lesemann  Manager, Institut f¨¹r Kraftfahrzeuge (ika), RWTH Aachen University Steinbachstra?e 7, 52074 Aachen, Germany +49-241-8027535, E-mail lesemann@ika.rwth-aachen.de  Andr¨¦s Aparicio  Project Manager, IDIADA Automotive Technology SA L¡¯Albornar, 43710 Santa Oliva, Spain +34-977-166029, aaparicio@idiada.com  Jan Jacobson Head of Section, SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden Brinellgatan 4, 50115 Bor?s, Sweden +46-10-5165697, jan.jacobson@sp.se  ABSTRACT Novel active safety functions are introduced in road vehicles. Cars, trucks and buses are equipped with functions to avoid collisions. The performance of these active safety functions must be possible to test and assess. There are several initiatives how to test active safety. This paper gives an overview and comparison of initiatives worldwide which lately have been or are currently dealing with the topic of active safety performance testing.   INTRODUCTION Modern society strongly depends on mobility, and the need for transport of both people and goods is expected to grow further in the future. Cleaner, safer and more efficient transport systems are needed. Mobility and especially road transport cause major societal problems: accidents, pollution and congestions. More than 34,000 lives were lost in 2009 due to road accidents in the European Union only, and the costs are estimated to be about 2 % of its GDP (1).  The development of road vehicles during the past decade has led to vehicles with improved passive safety. Systems of airbags, seat belts and protective structures have increased safety -2- for the drivers, passengers and lately also pedestrians. Testing programmes for assessment of these passive safety measures have been established.  Active safety functions such as Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Advanced Cruise Con-trol (ACC) have been introduced. The purpose is to try to avoid accidents through active sup-port to the driver. The active safety functions are under rapid development and there is pres-ently, and in contrast to passive safety, no generally accepted assessment programme in place. Several initiatives have identified this need for standardised testing and assessment methods over the past years, Fig. 1. While some of them are on-going, similar, but different methods have been presented recently and will be discussed in the following.   Fig. 1 - Performance testing requires targets and specified test methods  CHALLENGES FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING Performance testing has to be performed with limited efforts. This will also put requirements on the efforts needed to install measuring and control equipment in the vehicle under test. The most efficient way to equip a vehicle would be to install a stand-alone measuring system to record data such as position, speed, acceleration, yaw rate and distance to the target.  The testing protocols which describe the test procedures and the test cases must be robust to variations of test conditions. The same test results shall be obtained on different test tracks, with different test drivers, different measurement equipment and sensors, different target ob-jects, at slight variations in the environmental conditions, and for different individual vehicles of the same type with the same safety functions. The targets used in performance testing must be developed to facilitate repeatable testing. Interpretation of the testing result is complex because of the need for considering driver¡¯s response and quantifying the safety effects in terms of indicator values derived from measur--3- able data. The results of the performance testing must be possible to represent in a way that is easy to understand. The chosen safety performance indicators must also allow comparing re-sults between different tests. Examples of such indicators are collision speed, yaw rate and wheel lift.  A large amount of data will be recorded during the performance testing. This data has to be processable and interpretable in an efficient way. The measured data will then be used to cal-culate safety performance indicators describing the performance of the safety function. Post-processing of measured data should be automatable and representable in a clear format.   IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES Evaluation of the functional performance of a preventive safety system considers the technical performance of the function as well as the overall safety effects, i.e. evaluation that the func-tion does what it was designed for. Technical performance testing aims at investigating whether a safety function meets technical requirements and specifications on what the func-tion shall do.  Performance testing is best performed in specific traffic scenarios. The scenarios should be chosen accident statistics to be representative of situations where accidents are common. It has been proposed by the eVALUE project (2) to use longitudinal, lateral and stability sce-narios. This is both in line with the most common forms of accidents as well as active safety functions implemented in vehicles of current generations.  Tests should be performed applying an approach to test the performance of the complete ve-hicle. It should not be the aim to assess the technical specification of individual systems. The development of technology will create new systems and make a system-based approach ob-solete.  INITIATIVES FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING Several research and development initiatives are currently running both on European and na-tional level within the member states of the European Union. Examples of European research projects are the eVALUE project (2) and the ASSESS project (3). The main focus of the eVALUE project was to define objective methods for the assessment of vehicle active safety. As the main outcome of the project, the eVALUE consortium has defined test methods fo-cusing on the objectiveness and repeatability while rating remains up to the users of these methods.   -4- ASSESS PROJECT The ASSESS project is funded under the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission and started in mid-2009 with 15 partners in total. The goal is to develop a rele-vant set of test and assessment methods applicable to a wide range of integrated vehicle safety systems in the longitudinal domain. More precisely, the focus is on pre-crash sensing per-formance and crash performance under conditions influenced by pre-crash driver and vehicle actions. This includes a study of the relevant driver behaviour as well as the development of a standardised target representing a vehicle.  The ASSESS project is partly based on the results of the eVALUE project with respect to the longitudinal domain. With its more focussed investigation of pre-crash functionality and re-lated assessment, it shows an approach that can lead to the required level of detail with com-prehensive protocols ready for implementation in the short term.  EURO NCAP ADVANCED Euro NCAP has recently launched its "Euro NCAP Advanced" award system for new and emerging safety technologies (4). It aims to provide car buyers with guidance about the safety benefits which these new technologies offer. The new reward system, complementing Euro NCAP's existing star rating scheme, will recognize and reward manufacturers who promote those new safety technologies which have a scientifically proven safety benefit. Many of the technologies are so new that no accepted standards exist to assess them. Euro NCAP has de-veloped a methodology which allows the potential safety benefits of any new technology to be determined. Unlike Euro NCAP's established assessments involving physical tests at a crash laboratory, the new process is based entirely on the assessment of scientific evidence presented by the vehicle manufacturer.   In addition, for the first time Euro NCAP has tested the ESC performance of all cars crash-tested in 2009. Since 2009 also the ESC fitment was included as an essential part of Euro NCAP's assessment leading to the overall award rating. Euro NCAP carried out ¡°sine-with-dwell¡± tests according to the ESC Global Technical Regulation (GTR), which is based on the US regulation FMVSS 126. During 2011, cars will be evaluated with a pass/fail criteria based on this regulation. In the coming years, a deeper analysis will be defined. This is a first step for giving an assessment of active safety systems.  vFSS WORKING GROUP vFSS is a working group on Advanced Forward-Looking Safety Systems that was initiated mainly by German vehicle manufacturers and research organisations, now seeking interna-tional cooperation with other European and non-European vehicle manufacturers as well as research organisations and institutions worldwide. The aim of the working group is the de--5- velopment of test procedures for driver assistance systems (in particular advanced emergency braking systems) in order to ensure a robust assessment of such systems. The work will be based on accident analyses and also addresses pedestrian safety issues. The ASSESS project is very much in line with the vFSS procedures on longitudinal safety systems, and the initia-tive is now actively looking for harmonisation with as many initiatives as possible, e.g. CAMP-CIB and AEB.  CAMP-CIB The Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) was formed already in 1995 in the USA between Ford and General Motors to accelerate the implementation of crash avoidance coun-termeasures in passenger cars to improve traffic safety. In the meantime, other companies and institutions have joined the partnership. It is engaged in cooperative research with the Na-tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to advance the safety research objec-tives of the Department's Intelligent Vehicle Initiative and also partly funded by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). As a sub-project, the Crash Imminent Brak-ing (CIB) consortium started in 2009 the investigation of ¡°Objective Tests for Imminent Crash Automatic Braking Systems¡± (5). The purpose of the project was to define minimum performance requirements and objective tests for crash imminent braking systems and to as-sess the harm reduction potential of various system configurations and performance capabili-ties.  AEB GROUP An international group of insurer funded research centers is called RCAR (the Research Council for Automobile Repairs). Some RCAR members have formed a focus group, the so-called AEB group (6), with the aim of defining a set of test procedures that can be used by consumer test organisations such as Euro NCAP, IIHS and Thatcham. Thatcham is leading this group that also claims to be supported by a vehicle manufacturer and a tier 1 component supplier.  The AEB group states to plan basing its test procedures on real crash scenarios taking into account both frequency and severity. Therefore, they will use data sources that include insur-ance and national statistics as well as in-depth accident investigation. Test devices and tests able to represent these real world scenarios will be developed by the AEB group. They will publish their tests and shared them with other working parties which was done for instance with the vFSS initiative.  ADAC AEBS German motoring club ADAC, also a member of Euro NCAP, presented in 2011 results of a test series that investigated advanced emergency braking systems (AEBS) (7). The ADAC -6- AEBS test assessed the AEBS capability to reduce impact speed as well as when and how effectively the driver is alerted to an imminent collision in six current family and executive car models. According to ADAC, preventing a collision because of timely warning is always better than an autonomous emergency braking with unforeseeable consequences. As another important factor for enhanced driver safety, ADAC has identified system reliability. They conclude that most drivers will not accept false alarms even if they are no injury risk; unlike accidental emergency braking, which may be fatal. Their test also assessed the probability of false alarms or unnecessary emergency braking.  STANDARDISATION ACTIVITIES In addition, standardisation organisations (8) have already produced some standards on a sys-tem level, but not yet at a functional level based on traffic scenarios what is known to be most effective and demonstrative to the end-customer as learnt by passive safety assessment.   COMPARISON AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT Several initiatives are currently working on testing, evaluation and assessment of active safety functions of road vehicles. The majority of them is at the moment dealing with functions that provide warning or intervention in the longitudinal direction. All of them are based on critical scenarios that were derived from an investigation of accident statistics. However, there some differences in the scenarios proposed for test and assessment, most likely due to differences in the accident statistics that were analysed. This includes differences in the driver behaviour between European and also other countries worldwide. The fact that the differences of the initiatives are small seems to allow a successful harmonisation process in the coming months and years.  In terms of ESC assessment, some consumer-oriented testing organisations such as NHTSA or Euro NCAP have recently started to apply methods which have been developed over the past years. In addition, functions like ESC or ABS have a high market penetration as they are compulsory in many markets. Hence a lot of experience exists in terms of testing, leading to both sophisticated test methods, but also intensive discussions among the numerous experts in this field. It is expected that the publication of Euro NCAP¡¯s results and inclusion in the over-all rating will lead to a fast implementation and adoption of the assessment scheme.  The next functionality that will be addressed by the initiatives is obviously pedestrian detec-tion. vFSS and a related European project (AsPeCCS) as well as CAMP have started working on these functions and it is expected that proposals for testing and evaluation will be pre-sented in 2011 and 2012.  -7- SUMMARY An international approach for performance testing of active safety functions is needed since the automotive market is global. Initiatives from Europe or the US alone will not suffice to establish performance testing methods applicable on the international market. The perform-ance testing can be used by the automotive industry in the work to improve active safety functions. The suppliers and appliers (i.e. OEMs) of the active safety systems will benefit from the standardised test methods and tools specified.  Increased knowledge of performance testing methods will lead to increased user awareness. The people buying cars, buses and trucks will be able to compare different active safety func-tions and judge the safety benefits. Comparison between makes and models of cars will be made easier. An increased focus on the benefits of active safety functions will lead to a higher awareness and demand of these technologies.  The current situation especially regarding longitudinal and stability-related (i.e. ESC) func-tions is promising by means of a potential global harmonisation. This process must be driven by all involved stakeholders to succeed and requires and intensive exchange between all.  OUTLOOK The support action ActiveTest within the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission has the objective to bring together all relevant initiatives in this field. A dedi-cated experts workshop involving all relevant stakeholders will have taken place after the production deadline of this paper, but before the ITS World Congress. First conclusions will be part of the presentation, which will afterwards be available from the project website www.activetest.eu.

1??OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE FOT EXECUTION PHASE OF EUROFOT EUROPEAN LARGE SCALE FIELD OPERATIONAL TEST Andras Csepinszky Project manager, ERTICO-ITS Europe?326, avenue Louise, 1050 Brussels, Belgium?Tel.: +32 2 400 07 47, Fax: +32 2 400 07 01, a.csepinszky@mail.ertico.com ?ABSTRACT During the last three years, the integra ted project euroFOT co-financed by the European Commission has been organising the first large scale European Field Operational Test (FOT) evaluating Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). More than 950 cars with around 1200 drivers in six countries are currently monitored. The purpose of the paper is to show and demonstrate the execution of the recommendations, guidelines and actions previously  defined for the operation of the V ehicle Management Centres (VMCs), which are responsible for the Field Tests inside euroFOT.  The present paper provides details on the driver and vehicle acquisition procedures and on the installation of t he selected data loggers an d data acqu isition systems i nto t he vehicles underlining the list of lessons learned after h aving started the experim ental phase of the project, in parti cular regarding some d ifferences betw een the in itial p lans and the implemented procedures.  The basis of the paper is the deliverable D5.2 of the Integrated Project euroFOT, a large scale European Field Ope rational t est in  which v ehicle manufacturers, au tomotive suppliers, institutes and other sta keholders have joined force s i n a "smart drive" to t est various in telligent in-vehicle sy stems across  Europe, w ith the aim  of making our road transport safer, more efficient, and more comfortable.  INTRODUCTION The European Integr ated P roject euroF OT (FP7) ai ms to establish a comprehensive, technical, and socio/economic assessment programme for evaluating the impact of intelligent vehicle systems on safety, the environment, driver efficiency. The project is assessing several technically mature systems using vehicles that include both passenger cars and trucks across Europe. 2??A variety of intelligent vehicle systems (IVS) are being tested on a large scale in real driving conditions. Some 1500 IVS-equipped vehicles will be driven over th e course of one year, tested on roads across Europe. The objectives of the testing are to: o Assess various aspects of in-vehicle systems, such as their capabilities and performance, and the driver¡¯s behaviour and interactions with those systems o Gain a b etter u nderstanding of th e short- an d long-ter m socio-econ omic impact of such systems on safety, efficiency and driver comfort o Provide earl y publicity  of the systems to  the consu mer and create wider acceptance of them The results of euroFOT are expected to be a major contributor to the processes of deploying ICT systems for transp ort across Europe. The insights gained during the project will help policymakers decide on the right po licy framework, and business leaders to make informed decisions on the best way to bring these technologies to the market.  ORGANISATION OF THE VEHICLE MANAGEMENT CENTRES WITHIN THE PROJECT  Figure 1 Operational structure of euroFOT 3??The different Vehicle Management Centres are divided as follows:  French VMC:  CEESAR (Renault) with INRETS (LIVIC) German VMC: German VMC ¨C Operation Centre 1: VW/AUDI + FORD + MAN, all with IKA German VMC ¨C Operation Centre 2: Daimler (DAI) + BMW, both with IZVW Italian VMC:  Centro Ricerche Fiat (CRF) with Politecnico di Torino (POLI) Swedish VMC: Volvo Technology (VTEC) + Volvo Cars (VCC), both with Chalmers  4??LOGGING DEVICES  Many different logging devices had been used: CTAG datalogger 2 by the French VMC, the German VMC Operation Center 1 (Ford, MAN, VW) (see figure)  Figure 2 CTAG datalogger 2 The German VMC Operation Centre 2 (BMW and Daimler) has decided to develop their own data logger system (see figures) Figure 3 BMW datalogger unit Figure 4 BMW datalogger's storage unit   5?? Figure 5 DAG datalogger The Swedish VMC decided to use the NexCom VTC6100 which is an automotive grade PC solution (see figure).  Figure 6 NexCom VTC6100 base datalogger system 6??DRIVER ACQUISITION Several different approaches were considered and used: Direct customer contact through car dealers (Ford, Italian VMC, French VMC) Direct customer contact through fleet operators (VTEC, MAN) Direct customer con tact proposing c ar leasing with  reduc ed leasing fe e as incentives(Daimler, BMW) OEMs own fleet with employees (VCC) Each solution had advantages and in conveniences: the d ealerships o f the different car manufacturers provided an efficient way to deal w ith the recruitment as they are in contact with the customers having the necessary means and experience to deal with them.   LESSONS LEARNED Development, planning Tested functions with low market pe netration need strong marketing e ffort sin ce t he beginning of the project. This involves dir ect i nvolvement of t he car manufacturer's marketing department: with their direct suppor t the identification of the usuers is q uicker, simpler and more efficient. OEMs participation is needed while establishing the experimental design and the recruiting policy. As the OEMs a nd their marketing department have direct inf ormation about their costumers it is obvious that they can help the Filed Operational Tests' management to identify and to develop the most appropriate methods. Organisation The VMC has to be the central element in the project organisation. The VMCs structure gives considerable ind ependence on the e xecution of t he F OT oper ation. This may also h elp splitting the project into smaller FOTs (subprojects) which could make sense in cases where each subproject studies one functi on only or use different methodology or apply different acquisition method.  Regular fa ce-to-face meetings at t he V MCs t urned out to be a ver y effective tool to synchronize development and management efforts. In a ddition to this the meetings help to understand the d ifficulties in a very heterogenic test environment and provide a common platform of discussion for the consortium members. 7??Legal and ethical issues The product's warran ty of the au tomotive manufacturer (i s void if a c ustomer connects unauthorized equipment to the vehicle) should be discussed prior the recrui tment process to avoid later issues with the participants vehicles. Several months should be planned to clear all issues involving the legal department of the car manufacturers. Once a solution is established by the l egal d epartments th ese s hould b e i mplemented an d us ed duri ng th e recruitment process. Participants should be informed. Because of the privacy  issue of the vi deo recordings, many drivers had doubts abou t giving their p ermission in consent forms. Cle ar communication is ne cessary w ith the re cruited drivers explaining the use of the recorded videos and the publication of the results. The ownership and the future use policy of the gathered data should be defined in very early stage of the project.  Piloting related issues The piloting phase as one of the most critical part of the project should be scheduled much longer in order to test all aspects of the tests including recruitment procedures, hardware and software issues. It should cons ider the testing of all FO T related procedures: driver and  vehicle recruitment, incentives, questionnaire handling, data gathering and uploading, data pre-processing, equipment installation and de-installation.  Pilot tests must start after most of the technical issues were settled and resolved as well as after having all organizational procedures have been developed and deployed. It is important to understand that the pilot phase should test the whole experimental design of the FOT and not only the physical implementation of the test equipment. Thus th e pilots should provide feedback concerning the whole experimental design and the practical issues. Driver recruitment and vehicle acquisition The driver recruitment procedure should be made in close cooperation with the marketing and sales dep artments of the OEMs. They  have all the necessary tools and experience to identify and to h andle vehicle custo mers. In addition to these contact materials s uch a s leaflets, brochures, videos for drivers recruiting are very important to maximize response rate and to keep the participants motivated to follow the project until the end of the tests. For this it is very important to communicate the goal of the whol e project during the recruitment campaign using the available dissemination materials, communication channels (newspaper articles, TV spots, interactive web sites with news flash service, etc.). The driver recruitment and the necessary technical modifications on the vehicles should be defined prior the pilot tests as these have big impact on the availability of participants. The pilot will then provide feedback on the efficiency of the selected recruitment methods and the complexity and time consumption need of the technical modification. With the result of the pilot these may be adj usted to better ans wer to the needs and  requirements of the field 8??operational tests. A solution  is to use car manufacturer owned vehicles used by  the their employees which made the installation of the test equipment much easier than in case of the customer cars recruited either by the dealerships or by the marketing department of the OEM.  The use of customer vehicles is acceptable only for CAN data logging, because for additional sensors a nd high-end data  logging the effort is too high and the modifications ar e unacceptable for normal customers. Considering a new v ehicle model for field operational test, recently released by OEMs, should only be made if the production vehicles are already available before the pilot phase. In cas e of low tak e rates of featu res to b e t ested lar ge efforts are n eeded to reac h geographically widespread participants. Because of the large effort need a multiple approach may be applicable: OEM's market department, fleet operators, dealerships. Contacting big dealerships may be useful to reach lots of cus tomers reducing time of co mmunication and facilitating i nstallation efforts while s mall d ealerships might hav e more direct contact to motivated customers which may results fewer dropouts.  Common intern ational driver recruitm ent co ordination can however improve sample representativeness for European driving population as a whole. Financial issues: in centives and th e relat ed taxation represent also an i mportant point.  Because of the heterogenic legal (and taxation) environment all VMCs had to d eal with the incentives payment independently. There was no common solution. Some operation site used reduced leasing fee, some used fuel vouchers, etc. Where incentives are given in cash, tax-regulations have to be considered. Also the amount of work involved to find the appropriate accounting procedure is considerable. In add ition to this the planned amount of incentives was not enough motivating it has to be calculated much higher.  The cost of cabling can include connectors which are not available in small quantities, thus rather small parts of a cabling cost much.  Subjective data gathering The subjective data gathering of the FOT is also an essential part providing the vision of the participants on the tested systems. To achieve high answer rate it is very good to duplicate or offer multiple options for filling in questionnaires (i.e. hard copy and electronic copy). It is very important to develop and improve a web-based survey tool for data collection in order to save time and prevent data transcription mistakes. An other way to increase the answer rate is to centralize the subjective data gathering implementing a multilingual data collecting tool which can be is very useful in order to simplify global subjective data collection.  During the preparation of the questionnaires which are to be used in different c ountries, the translations and related validation should be done from the very first draft. 9??Hotline, driver liaison During the FO T op eration phase th e driver contact t urned to be cru cial: h ardware and software issues can be solved quickly if the VMC has proper driver liaison procedure and an organisation implementing these procedures: in troducing the ¡°customer care centre¡± of the dealerships is very recommendable, due to the professional customer handling capabilities. It is very important to get in touch frequently with drivers, in order to ensure data collection, but this has to be done on case by case, since some driver could be disturbed by this.  CONCLUSION In euroFOT the project w as managing a very heterogeneous test environment with many vehicle types, sev eral sel ected dataloggers, many tested  functions and th eir variou s combinations. The geographical distribution of the operation sites and as consequence the different legal environments led to a very complex situation to deal with.  The project participants were successfully resolved these issues and are running a large scale field operational test while th e experi ences and fin dings will be transf ormed t o recommendations and guidelines which may be eventually used as feed-back in the updating process of the FESTA methodology which was the major source of guidelines used.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF ACTIVE SAFETY SYSTEMS ON SAFETY, TRAFFIC EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE FIELD OPERATIONAL TEST ¡°EUROFOT¡±  Mohamed Benmimoun Institut f¨¹r Kraftfahrzeuge, RWTH Aachen University (IKA) Steinbachstr. 7, 52074 Aachen mbenmimoun@ika.rwth-aachen.de  Dr. Adrian Zlocki Institut f¨¹r Kraftfahrzeuge, RWTH Aachen University (IKA)  Mikael Ljung Aust Volvo Car Corporation (VCC)  Freek Faber TNO Mobility and Logistics (TNO)  ABSTRACT  Within the large scale field operational test (FOT) ¡°euroFOT¡± an impact assessment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is conducted. Altogether, about 1000 vehicles equipped with eight different ADAS technologies will take part in the field operational test. The focus of the analysis is an impact assessment on safety, traffic efficiency and environment. This paper will present the elaborated methodologies for conducting the safety impact assessment by means of the collected data from the field test.  The safety analysis represents the most challenging part of the impact assessment, because no standardized methodologies exist. For the impact assessment on traffic efficiency and environment traffic simulation as well as other models (emission models) will be applied to estimate direct and indirect traffic flow effects as well as environmental impacts. The focus of this paper is the discussion on the safety impact assessment, which has been elaborated for the specific conditions within the euroFOT project. The objective of the safety analysis is to determine the change in accident risk, while driving with the ADAS functionality. Altogether two approaches have been defined for the safety impact analysis and adapted to the specific conditions in euroFOT, the event based analysis (EBA) and the aggregation based analysis (ABA). The EBA approach is applied for functions, which intend to reduce the frequency of particular time discrete events (e.g. number of unintended lane crossings). Whereas the ABA is applied for functions that change certain driver performance measures over time (e.g. distance behaviour). The necessary safety indicators cannot be determined directly from the objective data, but need to be derived by means of surrogate measures.   INTRODUCTION  euroFOT intends to analyze the efficiency of ADAS that are already present in the market or are sufficiently mature enough to be tested as commercial systems. Based on the recommendations on existing roadmaps and on the availability of well developed systems, the following group of eight systems has been selected for euroFOT:   1. Longitudinal systems: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Speed Regulation System (SRS) 2. Lateral systems: Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Impairment Warning (IW) and Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) 3. Advanced applications: Curve Speed Warning (CSW), Fuel Efficiency Advisory (FEA) and Safe Human-Machine Interaction (SafeHMI)  These functions will be evaluated in different vehicles supplied by different European manufacturers. Different data acquisition systems installed into the vehicles will be used to collect a wide range of data (CAN-data, video, GPS location, etc.). The FOT is being carried out at various test sites across four European countries (Sweden, Germany, France and Italy).  IMPACT ASSESSMENT  euroFOT includes various impacts assessments, for example of traffic efficiency, environmental effects, user acceptance and other user-related-aspects, as well as safety impact assessment. The main objectives of the impact assessment are: ¡þ to analyse the effects on EU level for the ADAS tested on traffic efficiency, safety and the environment at various penetration rates (low / medium / high), ¡þ to provide input for the cost benefit analysis. The impact assessment translates effects found in the trips made by the equipped fleets in the FOT to the EU level. This basically means scaling up effects found in the FOT data, for certain situations or for certain groups of drivers. This leads to an understanding of the effects of ADAS if they would be used in entire Europe. Several of the tested ADAS are safety related. The assessment of the safety impacts is an important component of the overall assessment. The focus of this paper is on the methodology that will be used to perform this assessment in euroFOT. While the FOT provides objective as well as subjective data on driver behaviour with and without the evaluated ADAS, this data does not directly provide the necessary indicators for a complete safety impact assessment. Since there will be very few crashes (if any) in the FOT, it cannot directly provide numbers on fatality reductions or results for higher penetration rates. An analysis methodology is needed to transform the FOT data into impact indicators. For efficiency and environment, it is fairly straightforward to set up this methodology [1]. For safety this is more challenging, because no standardized methodology is known. Moreover the mentioned gap between the data that will be provided by the FOT and the required safety impact indicators needs to be closed.  The required safety impacts need be derived by means of surrogate measures such as to which extent the frequency of near crashes is reduced by ADAS presence, to which extent a safety margin measure like time-headway (THW) is increased by ADAS presence etc. Changes of these surrogate measures will then be translated into an expected change in the number of fatalities, injuries and property damage as a function of ADAS presence, by applying the ADAS induced changes on relevant crash statistics. For this aspect several safety related hypotheses have been defined (e.g. ACC decreases the number of forward incidents). In general safety related hypotheses are focused on the number of crashes, number of incident events, number of hard braking events, change in THW, change in time-to-collision (TTC), change in average speed etc.. These hypotheses will be tested under different environmental conditions (e.g. road type, weather conditions, traffic density etc.) and will be used as an input for the safety impact assessment.  While literature provides several examples of methods dealing with obtaining safety impacts, e.g. the methods developed in AIDE [2] and eIMPACT [3], none of these methods is fully suited to be used on FOT data. These approaches are mainly based on the derivation of the accident risk by means of surrogate measures, such as average speed or speed limit violations. The risks are partly determined by means of subjective data, because no objective data was available. Moreover for some surrogate measure no consensus was reached about the relationship between surrogate safety measures and the expected changes in the number of fatalities, injuries etc, e.g. impact of speed on accident risk. In some cases these methods are not applicable because different types of data have been used. Within euroFOT a suited safety impact methodology has been elaborated, which is described in the following.  SAFETY IMPACT ASSESSMENT IN EUROFOT  The goal of the safety impact assessment in euroFOT is to provide an estimate of the potential safety impact each ADAS could have, if installed in a wider fleet of vehicles on the road. The term ¡°safety impact¡± is here intended along the lines of an ADAS impact in terms of expected changes in crash numbers and associated injuries/fatalities. The components of the assessment are described in Figure 1 below. The starting point is to define the target crash population, i.e. the set of crashes which the ADAS is intended to prevent. Next, the FOT data is analysed by means of Event Based Analysis (EBA) and/or Aggregation Based Analysis (ABA) in order to determine whether the presence of the ADAS significantly impacts any safety related measures.  Finally, any identified impact needs to be interpreted in terms of how the target crash population could be expected to change if the ADAS was widely deployed.    Figure 1. The three steps of safety impact assessment in euroFOT In the following, these steps will be described in more detail, followed by example illustrations of how the procedure can be applied. Definethetargetcrash populationEBA analysis¨Cidentifychangesin crashrelevant eventfrequenciesABA analysis¨CidentifydriverperformancechangesoverlongertimeInterpret thechangebetween baselineandtreatmentin terms of generalisedsafetyimpactDEFINING THE TARGET CRASH POPULATION The first part of the benefit analysis is fairly straightforward, and involves defining the target crash population, i.e. the set of crashes which a particular function is intended1 to, and capable of, preventing. For example, for Forward Collision Warning (FCW) this is the set of rear end crashes which occur within the function¡¯s operational scope (certain ego vehicle speeds and approaching speeds to lead vehicle). For Lane departure warning, this is the set of crashes which start with an unintentional lane departure, and again, which are within the function¡¯s operational scope (visible lane markers, above certain ego vehicle speed, etc.).  Once the target crashes have been identified, data describing the crash circumstances should be cross tabulated in order to identify the most typical conditions under which these crashes occur. The intention of this step is to provide a filter, or set of limitations, in the analysis of the actual FOT data. In principle, any ADAS driven change which occurs outside this envelope of crash typical circumstances will not affects the safety impact (since by definition no relevant crashes occur outside those conditions). Thus omitting that data portion for the analysis saves time and effort, as well as focuses the analysis.  To provide the best fit with FOT data, the data source used for defining the target population should typically be a national crash database covering the country or countries where the function is being evaluated. It should be stressed that some modifications to the crash types used for that country/countries probably will be necessary, as the crash typology used to extract relevant crashes needs to be comparable to those used in other similar national databases (if not, the up-scaling of potential impact to the European level becomes a very difficult task).  In euroFOT, the identification of the target crash population will be based on the work of many previous and ongoing projects which already have addressed this issue from various angles. In particular, it is foreseen that the crash typology developed in the ASSESS project [4] will provide a good starting point, at least for cars. The ASSESS typology has the advantage that it is set up to select crashes uniformly in Swedish, British and German crash data, which matches the countries where many of the euroFOT ADAS are being evaluated. Moreover ASSESS provide an estimate of the costs and injuries associated with each crash type. In principle the ASSESS work can be used as the basis for projecting any identified crash risk changes due to ADAS presence onto injuries (including fatalities) and economical costs.  IDENTIFYING CHANGES IN SAFETY RELATED MEASURES BETWEEN BASELINE AND TREATMENT  The second part of the methodology is quantifying the impact of the presence of an ADAS, i.e. quantifying any changes in crash risk between baseline (no ADAS) and treatment (ADAS present). It is important to recognize that the number of actual crashes occurring during euroFOT is small. Basically, even when hundreds of drivers are being observed during a full year, the statistical likelihood of a crash occurring is low. This means that the simplest and most direct measure of change in crash risk, i.e. the number of crashes which occur with and without the ADAS, is not available, at least not in sufficient numbers to reliably quantify a difference between baseline and treatment. Instead, other indicators of change in crash risk                                                    1 Intended is here to be understood as the set of crashes that function developers intend the system to address. While there also may be unintended effects of a safety system of either positive or negative nature, the evaluation of these is given a lower priority and will be carried out only once the intended effects are assessed given that resources for such work is still available.  have to be defined and used, such as the frequency of safety critical events or changes in driver behaviour that are known to be crash causation related. In other words, to determine whether a particular ADAS is successful in preventing a certain crash type, one must first develop an understanding of why that crash type occurs. Once that understanding is in place, a measure of change that captures the function¡¯s impact on that particular crash causation mechanism can be defined. For example, many rear end crashes are thought to occur due to unexpected lead vehicle braking while the driver is visually distracted from the forward roadway [5]. In relation to this crash causation mechanism, a FCW system can be understood as a tool for interrupting the driver¡¯s state of distraction and alerting him/her to the braking of the lead vehicle. If FCW is successful in this regard, one would expect among other things a decrease in the number of panic braking events2 for drivers of vehicles equipped with FCW. The frequency of panic braking events can therefore be used as an indicator of change in crash risk due to the presence of FCW. Another way of getting at the same crash causation mechanism of unexpected lead vehicle braking events is to increase the available safety margins, thus making sure the driver has sufficient time for detection and action once the lead vehicle brakes. This is the intended function of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which when activated (and within certain limits) precisely regulates the distance to the lead vehicle. By operating in this manner, ACC is intended to help the driver avoid the risk of inadvertently ending up in a situation where s/he is following close to a lead vehicle that may brake and being distracted at the same time (i.e. ACC negates the close car following aspect of the problem). To evaluate whether ACC is successful in increasing the safety margin this way, another measure of change than the frequency of panic braking is required, such as whether there is a change in average following distance, or the total driving time spent at time headways below one second. Considering these examples, it is obvious that not only the measures used to evaluate each ADAS needs to be chosen very carefully, but also caution must be applied when summing up the benefits of multiple ADAS (e.g. ACC and FCW) present in a single vehicle. The risk of inflating the safety impact assessment by double counting effects of two ADAS addressing the same crash type is apparent. A proposal for dealing with this issue is presented below.  Two types of analysis  As the examples above illustrate, the assessment of which impact the euroFOT functions may have require two general analysis types for identifying changes between baseline and treatment, depending on which function is being analysed and how its influence on crash causation mechanisms is conceived.  The first can be called Events based analysis (EBA). The basic principle of EBA in a FOT context is to identify time segments (events) thought to be predictive of crash involvement, and then compare the frequency of these in baseline (where no ADAS is present) and treatment (where an ADAS is present). Examples of events include situations where the driver performs a violent evasive manoeuvre [5], i.e. where the distance in time and/or space from an actual crash is very small. These events can be identified retrospectively in the driving data, together with interaction/confounding factors such as road type, speed limit,                                                    2 Panic braking can be defined in many ways. While Dingus et al (2006) found that brake force alone was not a useful predictor of critical situation involvement, a more targeted definition which more directly addresses the causation mechanism at hand could be offered, such as sustained braking events with high brake force, a large lowering of delta V, and where the driver was not looking at the lead vehicle when it started to brake.  traffic conditions, other systems etc., and then either analysed directly, or studied by for example implementing a simulation in which the events are further varied to explore potential outcomes. EBA analysis applies primarily to ADAS which are intended to reduce the frequency of certain time discrete events directly related to loss of control, such as crashing into a lead vehicle (FCW), unintended lane departure (LDW) and commencing a lane change when the adjacent lane is not empty (BLIS). It can also be applied to events more indirectly related to loss of control, such as deciding to continue to drive when driving capacity is severely degraded (IW) and various forms of speed selection (Speed regulation systems (SRS) or Curve Speed Warning (CSW)). As long as the ADAS influence on driver performance can be described using the occurrence of discrete events, EBA analysis is applicable. Examples of previous studies where EBA analysis has been applied are discussed in [5], [8], [9], [12.  The second general type of analysis can be called Aggregation based analysis (ABA). This is a process for defining the change between baseline and treatment in terms of how driving performance changes over longer periods of time, such as the expected average increase in following distances for ACC in the example above, or a general decrease in travel speed for drivers with SRS systems.  The basic principle of ABA is to identify differences between baseline and treatment in driver performance measures that are aggregated over longer time segments, such as changes in average time-headway or mean travel speed, and then relate these changes to changes to crash and/or injury/fatality risk. It follows that ABA analysis applies primarily to functions which are intended to change certain driver performance measures over time, such as fuel consumption (FEA), lead vehicle following distances (ACC), speed selection for curves (CSW) or speed selection in general (SL/CC). Again, the selection of measures has to reflect ideas on underlying accident causation mechanisms, and in what way a change in the aggregate performance measure is predictive of a change in actual crash/injury risk.   Note that EBA and ABA are complementary or synergistic forms of analysis for exploring the impact on safety of a particular ADAS. For example, while a potential increase in average time headway is best investigated with an ABA analysis, a potential decrease in the number of lead vehicle conflicts is best investigated with an EBA type of analysis. However, if both types of analysis are performed on the same ADAS, it is important to remember not to unconditionally sum these effects, as they presumably reflect changes in the same underlying causation mechanism.  Interpreting what the change between baseline and treatment means in terms of a generalised safety impact  The third part of the methodology is taking the quantified differences between baseline and treatment back to the target crash population, and calculating what the identified change would mean in terms of reducing that population. This part has two steps. The first is to decide which of the identified differences are to be used for the actual prediction, and the second is to calculate the reduction in crashes. Regarding the first step, one would ideally select and compare only events and/or aggregate measures which are known to be predictive of actual crash involvement, i.e. where it is legitimate to infer that a particular change in what is measured corresponds to a particular change in crash frequency.   Unfortunately, such established relationships are yet not fully established, at least not for FOT data. For example, in terms of events, while hard braking may seem a plausible candidate for event selection, in the VTTI 100 car study [5] they were not able to reliably identify near-crash events in lead vehicle following situations based on hard braking alone, i.e. such braking occurred also in many driving situations which they did not think were indicative of crash risk. Similarly but in terms of aggregate measures, while a reduction in mean speed could be indicative of a reduction in crash involvement, there is no empirical base available for estimating the importance of mean vehicle speed in FOT data in relation to crash involvement. The currently most well developed basis is the power model proposed by [17], where a relation between some speed parameter (usually mean speed) and accident severity is inferred. However, that model relates mainly to speed choice on highways and rural roads in free flow conditions, and the empirical basis comes from cross-sectional data measured on selected road sections rather than from mean speeds as chosen by an individual driver across all possible driving conditions. The applicability of the model on FOT data therefore yet has to be validated (for an excellent discussion, see [18]). It follows that insight into crash causation mechanisms is the key both to the selection of relevant measures of change between baseline and treatment, as well as for interpretation of what those changes mean, in terms of how the target crash population may change if the evaluated ADAS is introduced on a larger scale in the vehicle fleet. Here, while the euroFOT effort naturally is guided by the numerous previous projects in the area (see for example [5] and [8-13]), and also expect to make its own contribution in terms of uncovering details on how driver behaviour relates to crash involvement, it should be kept in mind that crash causation still is a topic at the initial stages of exploration. For most measures, the estimates of safety impact will therefore lean toward the conservative.  If a difference between baseline and treatment has been established for an ADAS in terms of a risk indicator (e.g. in the frequency of safety related events or mean travel speed), the final step is the interpretation of this difference in the risk indicator in terms of change in the target crash population. This calculation can be done at various levels of detail. The simplest solution is to apply the identified change to the target population as a whole. For example, if the frequency of FCW relevant near crashes is 20% lower in the treatment phase, this could be used to predict a 20 % decrease in FCW relevant crashes and injuries if all vehicles were equipped with the system. A more sophisticated approach, but which also requires a larger data set, is to calculate the induced change and its relative impact for individual levels within the typical crash conditions before summing up. For example, if there are 2000 rural and 3000 urban FCW relevant crashes, and the near crash reduction ratio is 17 % for rural and 25 % for urban environments, the potential decrease in crashes would be (0.17*2000 + 0.25*3000)/ 5000 = 21.8 %.  This type of sophistication can also be extended to the injury calculations. For example, rather than assuming a general decrease in injuries and fatalities, it may be possible to assign severity levels based on for example the posted speeds under which the crashes in the target crash population occur (i.e. a higher posted speed generally implies higher initial vehicle speeds, and thus more severe injuries). Given that this holds, a 15 % reduction in near crashes would predict a higher injury prevention at the 90 km/h level than the 50 km/h level.  Example of Events Based Analysis (EBA)  To illustrate the process described above, an applied example of EBA analysis for a Forward Collision Warning / Adaptive Cruise Control system deployed in Sweden is described below.  1) Selecting a target crash population ¨C Volvo Cars are evaluating a FCW/ACC system in the Gothenburg area of Sweden, and this example will be based on the initial data that has been collected from those drivers. The data set consists of 8000 hours of driving, of which 4549 hours were in baseline and 3920 in treatment. As this comprises only about 10% of all the data that will be collected, it has to be stressed that this example is very tentative, and all numbers (except the size of the target crash population of course) will be subject to revision once the full dataset has been collected. To select a relevant crash population, data from STRADA was used. STRADA is a publicly available database that contains all police reported and most hospital reported traffic accidents that occur in Sweden. In order to find a relevant target population, , data from the years 2005 to 2008 was  compiled for analysis. From the total set, a slightly modified version of the ASSESS crash type described above was used to select relevant crashes. This included all passenger car crashes where the two vehicles were travelling in the same lane and direction when the front of one vehicle struck the rear of the other vehicle. The original ASSESS type was extended to also include situations when the car strikes a vehicle that is waiting to turn or turning (as these otherwise would be subsumed under the intersection crash type in ASSESS). The annual Swedish averages, cross-tabulated for the most important traffic environment conditions, are shown below in Table 1.  Table 1. Estimated annual average accident frequencies for FCW / ACC relevant crashes in longitudinal traffic for Sweden, based on STRADA data collected in 2005-2008. Highlighted cells represent ~92 % of all crashes.  Identifying change between baseline and treatment ¨CIn this step, a pool of crash relevant events were selected from the driving data by successive filtering steps. In order to find an initial set of events to apply the filters on, the simplest solution possible was used, i.e. the warnings provided by FCW were used to flag events. Next, these events were filtered in order to single out what could be called ¡°true¡± near crash events (there were no actual crashes in this data sample), i.e. events where a real crash was more or less imminent and where the driver can be expected to have benefited from being alerted to this fact by the ADAS when in the vehicle.  As can be seen above in Table 1, very few crashes occur at speed limits below 50 km/h. Thus, first fall events occurring at posted speeds below 50 km/h were taken away. Next, all events where the driver already had started to brake when the warning was given were excluded, on the assumption that getting a warning in that situation does not affect situation outcome. Last, all events where the maximum brake pressure during the event was at least 10 % of the highest brake pressures logged (thus excluding soft braking events), and where time-to-collision (TTC) at max brake pressure was less than 1 second (i.e. where the vehicles were close in time to colliding before the driver was comfortable with starting to release the brake pedal). These successive filters resulted in an outcome of 12 events, of which 8 occurred in baseline and 4 in treatment (note that other types of filters than those used here might be more relevant for the final analysis).  Annual average of FCW relevant crashes for cars in STRADA 2005-2008 Posted speed (kph) Total 30 50 70 90 110 Urban In junction Dry 9 291 57 5 1 1497 Not dry 5 174 47 5 1 Outside junction Dry 15 361 156 32 9 Not dry 9 192 91 32 8 Rural In junction Dry 1 39 86 77 7 1187 Not dry 0 25 49 37 8 Outside junction Dry 2 36 153 161 130 Not dry 1 17 87 124 150  3) Interpreting what the change between baseline and treatment means ¨C The final step is to interpret this difference between baseline and treatment in terms of influence on the target crash population. First, there is the issue of size and significance of an identified difference. To test this, many different methods described in [6] are available. The simplest form of comparison is to make a contingency table by counting the frequency of events in baseline and treatment conditions (based on some form of exposure normalisation, such as the number of events per driving hour) for each driver to understand, whether ADAS presence causes a change in event frequency. The risk change due to system presence can then be quantified and statistically tested using both relative risk (RR) ¦°1/ ¦°2 and/or the odds ratio (OR) (¦°1/ (1-¦°1))/(¦°2/ (1-¦°2)). It has been shown that OR approximates RR when ¦°1 and ¦°2 are small.   In Table 2 below, this has been illustrated for the example data. However, as this example represents only a small portion of what will be the final dataset, the significance testing not performed to avoid confusion with later results.    Baseline (system ¡°off¡±) Treatment (system ¡°on¡±) Number of crashes (or safety events) 8 4 Km¡¯s driven (or duration) 4549 3920 Crash (or events) rate 0,00176 0,00102 Odds ratio 0,579 Relative Risk (RR) 0,580 Table 2. Contingency table for events in baseline and treatment Now, if the numbers in Table 2 were taken at face value, it seems like the relative risk of experiencing a near crash relevant for driver with ACC/FCW is reduced with over 40 %, compared to not having that ADAS in the vehicle. Linearly extrapolated to the annual average of 2685 FCW relevant crashes in Sweden each year (see Table 1 above), that would mean a reduction of over 1100 crashes annually (600 ~in urban areas and 500 in rural). Of course, as this number comes from a limited dataset which has not been checked for consistency and biases, it only serves as an example and not as any type of prediction.  In terms of the methodology, a drawback of contingency tables is that it is only possible to consider one factor at a time, and interaction/confounding effects cannot be addressed. Furthermore, contingency tables assume that observations are independent of each other, an assumption which does not suit FOT data very well, as it will contain unavoidable driver-specific correlations (i.e. some drivers will experience more events than others). To study interacting/confounding factors and to account for these driver specific correlations, more sophisticated statistical models need to be applied. These models are generalizations of the linear models which have been adapted to a binary outcome, something which suits the EBA analysis division of events into baseline and treatment events well. These models include additional parameters to deal with correlations, and confounding factors are regarded as explicative variables that can be used to predict event probability.  One such model is the ¡°Generalized Estimated Equations¡± (GEE) model, originally developed to model longitudinal data by Liang and Zeger [7], which assumes that observations are marginally correlated. Another such model is ¡°Generalized Linear Mixed Models¡± (GLMM). Similar to the GEE model, GLMM assumes correlated observations for the same driver. In addition, GLMM also assumes that there is a random effect associated with each individual driver (i.e. one driver can be associated with higher and another with lower risk of event involvement). This has the additional advantage of allowing to control for a small population of drivers being involved in a large proportion of safety events, something which indeed may become an issue [5]. Both GEE and GLMM models can also accommodate multiple risk factors, which allow those factors to be evaluated simultaneously. Indeed, this capability may also be used to evaluate different systems in use at the same time or at different times but with possible interactions. For the final dataset, these or similar more complex models will be applied where appropriate, depending on the system tested and the events analyzed. For a more technical and detailed description, see [6] and [7].  Example of Aggregation Based Analysis (ABA)  A type of ABA analysis that is being developed in euroFOT combines time continuous changes in car following states of the vehicle (and driver behaviour) between baseline and treatment with computer simulation of lead vehicle conflicts. It estimates the number of accidents as the product of accident probability, accident severity and exposure, following established practice [16]. The first two factors together are called accident risk. The method can be seen as an adaptation of existing methods. In euroFOT this method will be applied to the functions ACC and SRS. Additional requirements on this method are the usability without video data, because most of the euroFOT vehicles do not have video data. Moreover it should be usable without in-depth accident statistics, because on the EU level there is only a high level accident database and it should run (almost) automatically after initial preparation. The latter requirement is motivated by the huge amount of data being produced in euroFOT which makes an interactive form of analysis practically impossible. Another motivation is that due to the size of project, the experts working with the data are typically not the safety experts involved in modeling safety impacts. The assessment method is set up such that users of the method merely need to provide the kilometers driven under various circumstances, from which the safety impact is determined automatically. The method assesses changes in potential crash involvement by sampling distributions of lead and following vehicle speeds and accelerations with ACC off and on from the FOT data, and then populating the starting conditions of the simulated conflict through random sampling from these distributions. In this way, a large variety of possible conflict outcomes can be explored, and it can be assessed whether those outcomes (in particular, the number or virtual crashes) differ significantly, if the starting conditions are sampled from treatment (ACC on) rather than baseline conditions (ACC off). The simulation applies a physical model with speeds, accelerations, distance-headway (DHW) and driver reaction time as input.  This approach is developed for rear-end accidents only. Initial testing has been conducted using a limited data set. Though the results do not have sufficient statistical power for drawing conclusions (due to the small data set), they seem to be reasonably in line with expectations. Additional testing is being performed with a larger data set, including sensitivity analysis and validation with crash statistics. The first results do show that the risk matrix approach is applicable to rear-end crashes. To apply it to other accident types, the relation between the risk indicator (e.g. impact speed) and the severity of the accidents need to be better understood.   Note that the EBA and ABA are complementary forms of analysis and should be applied according to the way the evaluated ADAS is intended to influence crash risk (i.e. the proposed causation mechanisms that the ADAS is intended to avert/mitigate). For some systems, both EBA and ABA analysis may be applicable, e.g. ACC maybe hypothesised to induce both changes in average time headway as well as changes in the frequency of hard braking events. However, if this is the case, it is important to remember not to unconditionally sum these effects, as they presumably reflect changes in the same underlying causation mechanism (more on this below). As a consequence additional mechanisms are considered in the euroFOT project to avoid handle this risk.  WHAT IF TWO OR MORE ADAS ADDRESS THE SAME CRASH TYPE?  If three different ADAS target the same crash type, it follows logically that their combined effect cannot exceed a 100 % crash reduction for that type. This simple reasoning points to the necessity of making a holistic and/or sequential type of calculation when considering the benefit of two or more ADAS addressing the same crash type.  One relatively simple, yet robust way of handling this problem is by positioning the ADAS in question along a timeline, or event line, where the ADAS which is farthest removed from the actual critical event is assessed first, and any impact that ADAS has is used to reduce the target crash population which comes next in the event line.  A hypothetical example is provided below in Table 2, where the potential benefit of fitting a single vehicle with eight different safety functions is estimated. The example starts from a total crash population of 100 000 crashes, and as can be seen to the bottom right; once the effect of all eight systems has been identified for there are still 18440 crashes that remain unaddressed. Or put reversely, the combined effect of the eight systems is estimated to 100.000 ¨C 18.440 = 81.560 crashes, i.e. an approximate total prevention estimate of 81.6%.  As stated, this approach is very linear in nature, and more complex real world dependencies may of course exist. For euroFOT however, an initial step would be to adapt a similar holistic model for the impact of certain functions. For example, ACC and FCW both mainly address the crash type 6a from ASSESS - Accidents in longitudinal traffic ¨C same direction [4], and for technical reasons, very few vehicles exist which have one but not the other (as they use the same type of sensing). It would therefore be recommendable to assess those together in terms of their influence on the ASSESS crash type, to avoid any double counting. For this, the FCW benefit calculation should in principle only be performed on the crash population that is left after the ACC benefit has been estimated, in order to avoid double counting (i.e. a crash cannot be prevented twice). Drawing a time line or phase diagram of the developing critical scenario (as for the road departure scenario in Table 2), and then reasoning about in which phase each function is active, partially resolves the issue of benefit calculation for multiple functions addressing the same crash type. However, one remaining problem is what happens when two functions address the same step of such a sequence, i.e. when their influence on particular crash type cannot be separated the sequential way.  The answer to this problem is twofold. First, an empirical solution may be available. If the same metric can be used to assess their influence, an initial step is to see whether this metric changes identically over the most relevant crash conditions. If they affect different portions of the typical crash conditions, that can be used as an indication of the functions being complementary. If they affect the same portions, this indicates that the functions indeed are redundant, and that either could be done away with without compromising the benefit.  Second, for euroFOT, this problem (at least so far) does not seem to arise. At least in relation to EBA analysis, the functions under evaluation all seem possible to place in logical steps along a projected critical timeline for their respective crash types. For example, for the Volvo cars participating in the study, the above example covers the sequentially of IW and LDW in relation to run-off-road crashes, as well as the sequentially of ACC and FCW in relation to accidents in same direction longitudinal traffic.   Table 3. Impact of multiple safety functions addressing a single crash type The final system being evaluated by Volvo cars, i.e. BLIS, is primarily intended for a specific crash type related to lane changes. While this on the kinematic level overlaps with situations in which LDW also would activate, the underlying mechanisms, and the driving conditions under which they typically occur, are most likely fundamentally different. While BLIS addresses under informed but intentional lane changes in a multiple lane, dense traffic environment, LDW is intended to address unintended lane departures in low workload driving conditions.  WHAT IF AN ADAS INFLUENCE OTHER CRASH TYPES THAN INTENDED?  In the discussion of how to identify the target crash population above, the idea is to select crashes which the ADAS is intended to address, which here is to be understood along the lines of design intent, i.e. the type of crashes which the ADAS designers foresaw as the main beneficiary of the ADAS, and which the ADAS therefore has been developed and tuned for. For example, for FCW this is the set of rear end crashes which occur within the function¡¯s operational scope (certain ego vehicle speeds and closing speeds to lead vehicle). For Lane departure warning, this is the set of crashes which start with an unintentional lane departure, and again, which are within the function¡¯s operational scope (visible lane markers, above certain ego vehicle speed etc).  However, an often raised worry concerns what is referred to as unintended side effects. While an unintended effect can be of either positive or negative nature, there is a concern that the presence of one ADAS may lead to an increase in non-intended crash types, i.e. crash types not directly related to the function. A hypothetical example would be FCW presence leading the driver to trust the FCW to alert him/her to forward critical events, in which case lateral control may decrease as a side effect of reduced driver attention to the primary driving task. If this occurs, FCW presence may lead to an unintended increase in the number of inadvertent lane departures.

Calculation is based on an assumption of 100.000 accidents of the same type.This concern actually can only be addressed on an empirical basis. In principle, for something like this to happen, some form of mediating mechanism must exist (such as the decrease in lateral control in the example above). If such a mechanism does indeed exist, its nature and influence can be hypothesized about and its influence can be tested for. For the above example, this would consist of looking at e.g. the standard deviation of lane position for FCW on and FCW off conditions, with LDW on/off as a control factor.   WHAT IF ONE ADAS INFLUENCES THE EFFICIENCY OF ANOTHER?  Another often raised worry concerns potential function interaction, i.e. that the presence of one function will influence the effect of another function. Paraphrasing the hypothetical example above, if FCW presence leads to a reduction in lateral control as a side effect of reduced driver attention to the primary driving task, the number of lane exceedences, and associated Lane Departure Warnings given, would presumably be higher for a driver with FCW than for a driver without.  On the empirical side, this is relatively easy to test for. As long as there is sufficient data in the treatment and baseline conditions, the frequency of LDW¡¯s given with FCW present compared to when in baseline, or the frequency of FCW¡¯s in ACC on and ACC off conditions, etc, be counted, normalized for exposure and then compared.   On the theoretical side, the implications of any differences found are less easy to determine. Ljung et al [14] found that drivers with previous exposure to LDW to a larger extent responded correctly to a FCW in an unexpected lead vehicle braking event, compared to drivers who did not interact with any ADAS prior to the event. On the other hand, in one of the on road studies performed under the AIDE project, FCW and LDW received positive ratings for usefulness and satisfaction when used separately. However, having both in the vehicle at the same time led drivers to rate LDW negative in terms of satisfaction and FCW negative in terms of usefulness [15]. In other words, the issue is multidimensional and plenty of more work is necessary to find a suitable solution.   SUMMARY  In this paper the approach for conducting a safety impact analysis by means of the data collected within euroFOT project is described. The defined approach in euroFOT is divided into two main steps. The event based analysis (EBA) is focused on the analysis of systems which are intended to reduce the frequency of particular time discrete events (e.g. Lane Departure Warning, Forward Collision Warning). The second method is called aggregation based analysis (ABA) and is mainly focused on systems that are intended to change certain driver performance measures over time, such as how much fuel is consumed (Fuel Efficiency Advisor (FEA)), lead vehicle following distances (Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)) and average travel speeds (Speed Regulation System (SRS). Both methods will be tested by using collected data within the piloting phase of the euroFOT project. The data collection phase will end by beginning of September 2011. Following this phase the data analysis will start. Within the data analysis the impact assessment with respect to impacts on safety, traffic efficiency as well as environment will be conducted. The results of the impact assessment will be available by spring 2012.  REFERENCES  [1] Benmimoun, A., Benmimoun, M, Wilmink, I., et al.

MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF TWO-WHEELEDVEHICLE ON THE BASIS OF BRANCH-AND-BOUNDGRAPH SEARCHDaisuke TOISHIGraduate school student, Meijo University,E-mail: 103430022@ccalumni.meijo-u.ac.jpEiji KONAKAAssociate Professor, Meijo University,1-501, Shiogamaguchi, Tenpaku-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, JAPANZip code: 468-8502,Tel: +81-52-838-2091, FAX: +81-52-832-2091,E-mail: konaka@meijo-u.ac.jpABSTRACTRecently, personal mobility whose wheels can be controlled independently (e.g.,Segway, i-Real and Winglet) has attracted attention. The con¡þguration of a two-wheeled vehicle, such as Segway, cannot be stabilized by continuous and time-invariantstate feedback due to its non-holonomic constraints. Because of the nonlinear natureof the nonholonomic constraints, the realization of a model predictive control (MPC)for this class of vehicles is a di¡þcult task.In this paper, the optimization of an input (i.e., velocity and steering) sequence isformulated as a graph search problem by restricting the inputs to discrete values. Alonger horizon MPC compared to that with nonlinear optimization can be realized.The advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated experimentally.INTRODUCTIONThe con¡þguration of a two-wheeled vehicle cannot be stabilized by continuous andtime-invariant state feedback owing to its nonholonomic constraints [1]. Because of thenonlinear nature of the nonholonomic constraints, the realization of a model predictivecontrol (MPC) for a vehicle has a high computational cost on account of the nonlinearoptimization[2][3][4].In this paper, we assume that the control input (i.e., velocity and steering) is restrictedto a ¡þnite set, e.g., forward, turn right, turn left, backward, etc. Thus, the con¡þgurationof the vehicle can be stabilized by a branch-and-bound graph search. This enablesfast optimization and MPC of the vehicle. Experimental results are present at theend of this paper. Note here that this technique can be applied to control personalmobility whose wheels can be controlled independently (e.g., Segway[5], i-Real[6] andWinglet[7]).PROBLEM SETUPThe dynamics of the two-wheeled vehicle considered in this paper is de¡þned asfollows:¨Bx(t)=¡þ¡þ¨Bx¨By¨B¦Õ¡þ¡þ=¡þ¡þ12Rw(¦Øl + ¦Ør)cos¦Õ12Rw(¦Øl + ¦Ør)sin¦Õ12WRw(¡þ¦Øl + ¦Ør)¡þ¡þ, u(t)=?¦Øl¦Ør?, u ¡ÊU =?u(1),¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,u(N)?,(1)where x =( x,y,¦Õ)T,a nd u denote the state (position and direction of the vehicle)and the input (angular velocity of each wheel), respectively. Rw and 2W denote theradius of each wheel and the tread, respectively. Note that the input is restricted to a¡þnite set U. The available input is only N patterns, e.g., forward, turn right, turn left,backward, etc. Figure 1 shows this system.Figure 1: System description of two-wheeled vehicleThe behavior of controlled variables can be predicted using the dynamic model of thesystem (1). Model Predictive Control (MPC) exploits this fact (The detailed discus-sions on MPC can be found in [8]). The prediction interval are de¡þned as predictionhorizon.Well-designed performance index is essential when someone wants to obtain suitablecontrol policy using numerical optimization. The performance index J is de¡þned asfollows:J =kf?k=0[x(kTs) ¡þxT]T Q[x(kTs) ¡þxT]T + P, (2)where k, kf,a nd Ts denotes the sampling index, prediction horizon, and samplinginterval, respectively. Q is a diagonal weight matrix; xT =( xT,y T,¦ÕT)T, the targetstate; and P, the penalty (described later). Note that input terms could be added tothis index.Here, de¡þne the performance index for pre¡þx state sequence x(0),¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,x(kp)i sa sfollows:Jp(kp)=kp?k=0[x(kTs) ¡þxT]T Q[x(kTs) ¡þxT]T + P, (3)The objective is to ¡þnd the optimal input sequence u(kTs),u((k +1 )Ts),¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,u((k +kf)Ts) that minimizes J. The notation uk:k+kf is used to simply denote the inputsequence from kTs to (k + kf)Ts. A branch-and-bound based optimization algorithmis proposed in this paper. The outline of the algorithm is as follows:Proposed AlgorithmThe proposed algorithm is shown in the following. Without loss of generality, assumethat the current time index k =0 .1. Given current and target states, x(0) and xT.Every node of the search tree are de¡þned to contain the state, input sequence, andcorresponding input sequence, i.e., (x(kp),u0:kp¡þ1,J p(kp)). At the beginning, thetuple (x(0),¡þ,J p(0)) is pushed onto a stack.Let JM be a large value.2. (branching) Pop a node from the stack. All inputs in U are applied to the stateand the next state and performance index Jp for each input are calculated.For instance, if the node (x(k),u0:k¡þ1,J p(k)) is popped from the stack, make nodes(x(k +1 ),u0:k,J p(k +1 )) where u(k)= u(1),¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,u(N).3. (bounding) Delete the branched nodes that satisfy the following conditions.(a) Input sequence is redundant, e.g., backward immediately after forward.(b) Bounding based on Jp of the corresponding node. Bounding conditions are:i. Jp >J M.ii. Jinf, that is de¡þned as the performance index following the ¡±ideal path¡±from current state to the goal, is larger than JM.(c) The time associated with the node is kf.i. If the corresponding performance index J = Jp(kf)i sl esst han JM,t henset J to JM.4. Penalize a Y-turn, e.g., turn right backward immediately after turn left forward.5. Push the remaining states onto the stack in descending order of J.(a) Terminate the algorithm if the stack is empty.The output of the algorithm is the optimal J and its corresponding input sequenceu0:kf¡þ1.If the optimal sequence can be obtained, only the ¡þrst sampling is applied to thevehicle. After one sample, x,y, and ¦Õof the vehicle are observed, and the algorithm isrepeated. As a result, MPC based on a graph search can be realized.Figure 2 is a schematic ¡þgure for kf = 3. Sold and dashled lines denote the real andpredicted trajectories, respectively. At time kTs, the optimal input sequence (turn left,straight, straight) is obtained. Therefore, only the ¡þrst sample turn left is applied andthe vehicle moves.Figure 2: Model predictive control (MPC)Some detailed improvements for reducing the computation amount are describedbelow.In branching, it is necessary to compute the next state. In order to calculatex((k +1 )Ts)f rom x(kTs)a nd u(k), one must solve nonlinear di¡þerential equation(1) numerically. The state evolution caused by the input u(i) from the origin (x =(0,0,0)T) is denoted as ¦¤ix. In order to obtain its value, solve¦¤ix =? Ts0¨Bx(t)dt =? Ts0¡þ¡þ12Rw(¦Øl + ¦Ør)cos¦Õ12Rw(¦Øl + ¦Ør)sin¦Õ12WRw(¡þ¦Øl + ¦Ør)¡þ¡þdt (4)using numerical method, such as Runge-Kutta method. ¦¤ix can be easily transformedinto the state evolution from any state (x =( x,y,¦Õ)T) as follows:¦¤?ix =¡þ¡þcos¦Õ ¡þsin¦Õ 0sin¦Õ cos¦Õ 000 1¡þ¡þ¦¤ix (5)Figure 3 shows this transformation. Before running the proposed algorithm, ¦¤ix areFigure 3: Transformation of state evolutioncalculated for all inputs u(i),i =1 ,2,¡¤¡¤¡¤ ,N . In branching procedure, ¦¤ix and itstransformation (5) are used to obtain state evolution, instead of numerical integrationof (4). This improvement can reduce the computation amount.Stack is used to realize depth-¡þrst search. Once the search reaches to the depth kf,JM is updated in 3.(c). Moreover, the states to be searched are pushed onto the stackin descending order in 5. Therefore, the most ¡±promising¡±state are preferentially-selected. If JM has small value in the early stage, many states are bounded and thesize of the search tree shrinks.¡±Ideal path¡±, appeared in 3.(b).ii., is de¡þned as follows: The vehicle is assumedto be headed to the goal, then the vehicle run to the goal at the maximum availablespeed. Jinf is de¡þned as the performance index when the vehicle follows the path. Jinfis always larger than Jp, then bounding using Jinf bounds more states and contributesto computation reduction.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSThe usefulness of the proposed algorithm is veri¡þed experimentally. A small two-wheeled robot e-puck[9] is used as the vehicle (Fig. 4). The size parameters of thevehicle are 2Rw = 27[mm] and 2W = 41[mm].The control input to the vehicle is restricted to nine patterns (Fig. 5, Table 1).The successive inputs of complementary pairs, e.g., u(2) (turn right forward)a nd u(8)(turn left backward), are canceled in bounding. Forward input (from u(1) to u(4))immediately after backward input (from u(6) to u(9)) is penalized, and vice versa. Theposition of the vehicle is measured every 0.125[s] using a stereo vision camera on theceiling. The proposed search algorithm is performed on the controller PC, then thecontrol command is sent to the vehicle via Bluetooth connection.The control input is calculated by the proposed algorithm every 1[s], i.e., Ts = 1[s],and it is applied to the vehicle. The prediction horizon kf is set to 10[s]. This horizonis longer than that reported in previous works (5[steps] in [2] and [4]). The parametersof the performance index are Q = diag(200,200,1) and P =1 .Figure 4: e-puck[9]Figure 6 shows the experimental result. The vehicle travels from initial state (0,0,0)to the target state (0.4,0.4,¦Ð). This result shows that the vehicle can reach the targetstate with one Y-turn. The total travel time is 28[s]. The ¡þnal position of the vehicle is(0.3973,0.3926,2.886). The average computation time is 45[ms].

1 A STUDY ON RELATION BETWEEN STEERING AND BRAKING TIMINGS BASED ON LONGITUDINAL COLLISION RISK PERCEPTION  Nguyen Van Quy Hung, Hirofumi Aoki, Yasuhiro Inuzuka Toyota Motor Corporation 1200, Mishuku, Susono, Shizuoka, 410-1193 Japan  Tel.: +81-55-997-7216, Fax: +81-55-997-7884 Email: nvq@hung.tec.toyota.co.jp  ABSTRACT In this study , we introduce a m ethod for real-t ime estimate of individual drivers¡¯ steering avoidance timing while the subject vehicle is approaching the lead ve hicle. We model the timing when a driver starts a steering avoidance m aneuver based on the hypothesis that the driver decides the tim ing based on his/her l ongitudinal collision risk perception, which is defined as the ratio between "p erceptual relative velocity" and "perceptual distance". The perceptual distance is the expone nt of the distance between the subject vehicle and the lead vehicle. Th e perc eptual relativ e ve locity is  th e velocity dif ference of these two vehicles corrected by the sub ject vehicle's velocity and their relative accele ration. Our ex periment results in the situation of lane-change for pa ssing the lead vehicle show that the proposed model can express steering timings of individual drivers at various conditions of the vehicles¡¯ speed and decelerations of the lead  vehicle. It  also shows  that th e steering and the braking timings can be described by sim ilar models only with dif ference on their parameters. The proposed models enable us to help clarify the relation between the tim ings of individual drivers in real-tim e. We found a more com plicated behavior of  drivers (in terms of their avoidance timings to steer or brake) in the hi gh-speed area of the s ubject vehicle. Also, it shows that while the m aneuver (steering/braking) timings are different from driver to driver, the one bra king later tends to steer  later. These varieties of the tim ings within-driver and between-drivers can be explaine d as a result of the dif ferences in d rivers¡¯ long itudinal collision risk perception.   Keywords: Driver Behavior , Preventive Safety , Collision Risk Perception, S teering Avoidance Timing, Braking Avoidance Timing  2 INTRODUCTION Understanding driver ¡¯s m aneuver tim ing play s an important role in im proving the effectiveness of driving support systems as well as driver ¡¯s receptiveness to the operation of  those systems. For example, when the subject ve hicle is approach ing a lead vehicle, if the system can estimate the driver¡¯s usual timings of steering and braking avoidance m aneuvers, it can provide support of avoidance, which matches the driver¡¯s sense of his/her normal safety driving. As a result,  the driver¡¯s awareness and receptiveness towards the suppo rt of the systems can be expected.  However, it is not triv ial to estimate drivers¡¯ usual timings of avoidance m aneuvers because of the variety upon drivers¡¯ perception toward the relative motion between the subject vehicle and the lead vehicle (relative speed, relative distance). It is known that the relative velocity is perceived faster and the relative distance is perceived closer than they are in reality when the subject vehicle velocity is higher [1].   For estimating the braking avoidance tim ing when the subject vehicle is approaching a lead vehicle, indices that reflect th e driver¡¯s visual input and perceptual risk s uch as KdB [2] and PRE (Perceptual Risk Estim ate) [3] have been  reported, recently . KdB is an ind ex for the approach toward the lead vehicl e based on a driver ¡¯s visual input on the retina. PRE reflects the driver's perceptual risk toward longitudinal direction through the human perception error in the relative distanc e and the rela tive speed. PRE has be en shown a  comprehensive and enhanced model of other indices of  collision risk and brak e timing such as TTC (T ime to Collision, i.e., relative distance divided by re lative velocity), THW (Time Headway), RP  (Risk Perception) [4] and KdB.  On the other hand, previous research efforts on estimate of steering maneuver timing include statistically modeling th e average tim ing based on the huge database of  several d rivers in normal driving situations [5][6][7], and inferri ng the timing based on the m odel of steering maneuver using a time series of data describing the states of vehicle (position in the lane, etc) and driver (head m otion, eye m otion, etc) [8][9][1 0]. It has been shown that the steering timing varies among individuals and varies with approaching conditions such as the subject vehicle speed or the moving state of the lead vehicle.   In this study, we propose a m ethod to m odel individual driver ¡¯s steering avoidance tim ing while the subject vehicle is approaching the lead vehicle. We model the steering timing based on driver¡¯s longitudinal collision risk perception  toward the lead vehicle. Then, we confir m the validity of the proposed model with individuals¡¯ steering avoidance timings when passing the lead vehicle by lane-cha nge under various com binations of relative velocities and 3 acceleration/deceleration of the lead vehicle. Based on the proposed model, we clarify the  relation between the tim ings of st eering and braking avoidance m aneuvers of individual drivers.  LONGITUDINAL COLLISION RISK PERCEPTION In our previous study , we for mulated the fo llowing Perceptual Risk Estim ate (PRE) as an index of the driver ¡¯s longitudinal collision ri sk perceptio n when the subject vehicle is  approaching a lead vehicle [3].

The perceptu al distance Dn reflects the phenom enon of human perception that the driver feels th e current distance is  shorter than the re al one. For s implicity, it is  assumed that 0=pforeseenA in our next development.  It was found in our previous study [3] that  PRE could express we ll braking tim ing of individual drivers with various combinations of relative ve locities, subject vehicle velocity and the lead vehicle d eceleration.

Therefore, we hypothesized the model of steering avoidance timing as in Equation 3.

First, we considered the difference on the sensitivity to vehicle speed. In the case of steering avoidance, a driver just changes the directi on of vehicle¡¯s momentum, which is proportional to the first-order of the vehicle¡¯s speed. In the case of braking avoida nce, on the other hand, the driver has to suppress the vehicle m otion ener gy, which is proportional to the second-order of the ve hicle speed. Therefor e, we hypothesized the following relation on driver¡¯s sensitivity to vehicle speed.  Hypothesis2: A driver¡¯s sensitivity to vehicle speed in case of steering avoidance is smaller than the one in case of braking avoidance. )4(brkstr ¦Á¦Á <  )3(constPREDApVsVrstrnstrstrstr ==++ ¦Â¦Á5 We confirmed Equation 4 by measuring the avoidance maneuver timings of a driver on a test track when the subject vehicle is  approaching a lead vehicle at a constant relative velocity (Vr=const, Ap=0).

In case of steering avoidance, it  can be thought that the reaction time is shorter than that of braking avoidance since the tim e to maneuver the steering handle is smaller than the time to change driver ¡¯s foot from  the accelerato r pedal to the brake p edal. Therefore, we hypothesized the following relatio n on driver ¡¯s reaction time to the deceleration of the lead  vehicle.  Hypothesis3: When the lead vehicle decelerates, the driver¡¯s reaction time is smaller in case of steering avoidance in comparison with the case of braking avoidance.  )5(brkstr ¦Â¦Â <   We confirmed Equation 5 by measuring the avoidance maneuver timings of a driver on a test track when the sub ject vehicle approached a lead vehicle with a con stant re lative speed (Vr=const, Vs=40km/h).

The steering avoidance timings of three drivers are shown in the perc eption relative velocity ¨C perception distance graph (Figure 4).  It was confirm ed that a driver decided to st eer when the ratio of the num erator and the denominator of Equation 3 was at a certain va lue under various com binations of the subject vehicle¡¯s velocity, the relative velocity , and the lead vehicle deceleration.

Figure 5 and Fig 6 show examples of steering and braking timings of the three drivers derived from the m odels. For sim plicity, we as sumed a constant speed of the lead vehicle ( 0=pA ), here. We described the tim ings with T ime to Collision (TTC, def ined as re lative distance/ relative velocity) ¨C Relative Velocity (Vr) graphs.   Figure 5 shows that a driver te nds to steer /brake earlier (TTC is lar ger) when th e vehicle speed increases from 60km/h to 100 km/h. However, this variety tends to be smaller when the relative velocity is higher.   Figure 5 also shows that the driv er tends to s teer earlier than to brak e at the low rela tive velocity. Otherwise, she/he tends to steer later than to brake at the high r elative velocity. The point at which this change in tendency ha ppens is called cross-point. However , this cross-point varies with the speed of the subject vehicle. For exam ple, the relative velocity at the cross-point becomes smaller when the sub ject vehicle¡¯s speed increases from  60km/h to 100 km/h.  Figure 6 shows that the above tendency betw een steering and braking tim ings are sim ilar among drivers. Also, there is a proportional re lationship between steering timing and braking timing of drivers. Among drivers, the one braking later also tends to steer later. However, the maneuver (steering/braking) timings are different from driver to driver.   DISCUSSION The results in Figure 5  show a more com plicated behavior of drivers (in term s of their avoidance timings to steer or brake) in high-sp eed area of the subject v ehicle. This can be explained by the difference on driver¡¯s perception toward relative v elocity in the h igh-speed area between steering and braking m aneuvers. Th is dif ference has been reflected as the relation between our models¡¯ parameters ( brkstr ¦Á¦Á < (Equation 7)).  The varieties between drivers of  their maneuver timings can be explained as a result of the 9 differences on drivers¡¯ risk perception threshol d PRE. For exam ple, in the case of s teering avoidance timing showed in Figure 6, that the a voidance timing of Driver2 is later (TTC is smaller) than the one of Driver3 is caused by the lar ger steering risk perception of Driver2 (PREstr_driver2) compared with the one of Driver3 (PREstr_driver3) (Equation 6).  Therefore, with our modeling technique, we are not only able to estimate driver¡¯s timings, but also able to understand the state or characteristics of an individual driver in the view of his/her perception toward vehicles¡¯ speed and relativ e distance ( n,¦Á ), as well as his/her reaction toward the moving states of the lead vehicle ( ¦Â). As a result, it enables us to provide appropriate supports of avoidance, which obtains the driver¡¯s awareness and receptiveness.   CONCLUSIONS In this study, we developed a m ethod to model individual driver¡¯s steering avoidance timing and clarified the re lation between steering and braking tim ings in the situa tion while the subject vehicle is approaching the lead vehicle. The following results have been obtained. ¡þ A model of steering timing was construc ted based on lo ngitudinal collision risk perception toward the lead vehicle. ¡þ The proposed m odel can expr ess steering timing of indi vidual drivers at various vehicle speed degrees, relative velocities, and decelerations of the lead vehicle. ¡þ The steering timing and the braking timing can be described using a similar model¡¯s structure ¡þ The difference between the steering timing and braking timing can be reflected by the differences on the constants of the models (Equation 3, Equation 2) ¡þ The proposed model of steering model (Equation 3) and braking model (Equation 2) enable us to estimate driver¡¯s avoidance maneuver (steer/ brake) timings in real-time. We found a m ore complicated behavior of  drivers (in term  of the ir avoidance timings to steer or brake) in high-speed area of  the subject vehicle. Also, it shows that while the maneuver (steering/braking) timings are different from driver to driver, the one braking later tends to steer later. These varieties of the timings within-driver and between-drivers can be explained as a result of the dif ference on their longitudinal collision risk perception.

In this paper, we evaluated wake-up sounds in a real environment where music or a radio is being played. The results showed  that p laying music can  generate a transient arousal state. Moreover, playing wake-up sounds along with mu sic can m aintain the arousal state for a longer period than playing music alone. In addition, we focused on the habituation to wake-up sounds, generated wake-up sounds that m ade habituation more dif ficult, and evaluated the sounds¡¯ effectiveness for arousal maintenance. The results showed that the wake-up sounds that prevented habituation could maintain th e arousal state for a longer period than the wake-up sounds that did not prevent habituation.   INTRODUCTION Recently, the main causes of fatal traffic accidents in Japan have been distracted driving and inattentive driving [1]. Much research has b een conducted to reduce inattentive driving using technologies for detecting face direction [2], eye direction [3], and so on, with some of these technologies already commerciali zed. Distracted driving is caused by a low arousal level, fatigue, abstractedness, and distraction. Abstractedness or distraction can be solved by getting the driver¡¯s attention, while fatigue can be solved by resting. Therefore, we address the issue  -2  -of a low arousal level, which is one of the causes of distracted driving. Maintaining an arousal state and recovering an  arousa l state are two  ef fective m easures against drowsiness. Maintaining an arousal st ate is ef fective when  the arousal level is comparatively high. Recovering an arousal state is a m easure that is used when the arousal level becomes low and needs to b e returned to a high level. We believe that it is im portant to remove the cause of traf fic accidents before they occur. Thus, we considered a m ethod to maintain an arousal state and hence prevent a decrease in the arousal level. We focused on the sounds that can be hear d in a m oving car (steady running noise) and constructed wake-up sounds by pr ocessing this steady running noi se. We then evaluated the effectiveness of these wake-up soun ds for ar ousal maintenance. We found that by adding a  heart beat rhythm  to the steady running noise and raising the acous tic pressure to the frequency band of wind noise, the sound can ef fectively maintain the driver ¡¯s arousal state [4]. However, to facilitate the use of this method in a real environment, numerous issues needed to be considered. For example, it is often the case that music is played or the radio is on in a real environment. Therefore, there was a question about whether the wake-up sounds could keep their effectiveness for arousal maintenance in an environment where these other sounds exist. Additionally, although it is im portant to maintain the arousal state for a long period in a real environment, a previous experiment found that the effectiveness of the wake-up sounds used for arousal m aintenance decreased significantly with time. Thus, ther e was the issu e of the wake-up sounds not being able to maintain an arousal state for a sufficient period of tim e. This paper presents measures to combat these two issues.  EVALUATION OF WAKE-UP SOUND AND MUSIC METHODS  In order to maintain an arousal state, drivers commonly listen to music or the radio in the car. However, if music or the radio is played for a long time, sometimes the driver¡¯s arousal level decreases even though the m usic or radio is s till playing. Additionally, music or the rad io might reduce the effectiveness of the wake-up sounds used for arousal maintenance. Therefore, in order to evaluate the ef fectiveness of using music for arousal m aintenance, as well as the effectiveness of using wake-up sounds for arousal maintenance in an environment where music is played, the arousal level was evaluated under three di fferent conditions. The first was a condition in whic h a steady running noise was played, the second was the condition in which both a steady running noise and music were played, and the third was the condition in which wake-up sound and music were played. Experimental Task To simulate monotonous driving, which m ay decrease a driver ¡¯s arousal level, participants performed a tracking task usi ng a 24-inch LCD and st eering wheel for a TV game, as shown  -3  -in Fig. 1, w hile hearing the sounds com ing from a speaker. Three sine cu rves and one circle are displayed on the screen. The three sine curv es had a 7.7-cm  amplitude, were separated from each other by 3.1 cm , had a period of 22.5 s, and  flowed from the top of the display at the rate of 2.2 cm/s. The circle had a diameter of 1.8 cm and was located in the center of the screen vertically. Participants were asked to keep the circle on the center sine curve using the steering wheel. The circle moved from side to side in response to the steering wheel. 52.0 cm32.5cm6.2 cmSteering Display7.7 cmT = 22.5 s.1.8 cm2.2 cm/sCircleX-axisY-axis Fig. 1 Tracking Task Sounds The steady running noise was the sound recorded in a car running at a speed of around 100 km/h. The evaluated sounds cons isted of three wake-up sounds, described as follows, whose effectiveness for arousal maintenance was validated in our previous experiments. These three wake-up sounds were randomly switched smoothly every three min, as described in Fig. 2. ¡þ Sound X: Raise the sound pressure level by 6 dB to the frequency band of wind noise  (1000¨C5000 Hz).  ¡þ Sound Y: Raise the sound pressure level by 6 dB to the frequency band of wind noise  (1000¨C5000 Hz) and add a heart beat rhythm  (80 times/min) to the entire steady running noise.  ¡þ Sound Z: Add a heart beat rhythm (80 times/min) to the entire steady running noise. The music was selected from the participants¡¯ favorite music that they usually listen to while driving.

The evaluation standard in method of Ohsuga consists of 4 categories: 1: Not Sleepy, 2: Slightly Sleepy, 3: Very Sleepy, 4: Almost Asleep. Visual Analogue Scale: The visual analogue scale (V AS) is a tool that is used to m easure subjective drowsiness. A 10-cm horizontal line segment is drawn on an evaluation sheet an d the words ¡°fully awak e¡± and ¡°very sleepy¡± are set on each end o f the line segm ent. Participants draw a vertica l line o n the horiz ontal line s egment to indicate their level of  drowsiness. The evaluation value is found by the distance from the word ¡°fully awake¡± to the vertical line in millimeters. Participants The participants were five men who all had good sleep cycles (age: 18¨C24 years). They gave written informed consent. Procedure Three patterns of tasks were carried out: ¡þ Pattern A: Play a steady running noise, and when  the participant feels sleepy, he pushes a button on the steering spoke. ¡þ Pattern B: Play a steady running noise, and when  the participant feels sleepy, he pushes a button on the steering spoke and plays music. ¡þ Pattern C: Play a steady running noise, and when  the participant feels sleepy, he pushes a button on the steering spoke and switches the steady running noise to the wake-up sound, while music plays at the same time. Every participant carried out every p attern.

Facial Expression Evaluation Fig. 4 shows the average values of the facial  expression evaluation. The horizontal axis  indicates th e elap sed tim e since th e participan t pushed the button, a nd the vertical axis  indicates their sleepiness level. This result s hows that the sleepiness level tended to increase  -5  -with time in every pattern, and that the sleepiness level of Pattern B was lower than that of Pattern A at first, while the sleepiness level of Pattern C was lower than that of Pattern A at all times.  The deterioration of consciousness and lack of  concentration shown in sleepin ess level 3 is  said to be a possible cause of traffic accidents. The bold vertical lines shown in Fig. 4 indicate the times when the sleepiness level in each pattern reaches level 3 for the first time. The time for Pattern A was 5 min, while that of Pattern B was 16 min. The sleepiness level in Pattern C never reached level 3.

These results show that the score of Pattern C was significantly lower than the score of Pattern A (p < 0.1). **p < 0.1Pattern A Pattern B Pattern C012345Visual Analogue Scale Fig. 5 Visual Analogue Scale DISCUSSION From the results for Pattern A and Pattern B shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we find that listening  -6  -to your favorite music can maintain an arousal state longer than listening to a steady running noise. Additionally, from the results for Pattern  A and Pattern C shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we find that listening to your  favorite m usic and the wake -up sound sim ultaneously can maintain an arousal state much longer than listening to the steady running noise alone. Putting it all together, it reveals that listening to music can maintain an arousal state for a while, while listening to your favorite m usic and the wake -up sound sim ultaneously can maintain an arousal state much longer than just listening to your favorite music.  MEASURE AGAINST HABITUATION A previous experim ent found th at a wake-up sound¡¯s effectiveness for arousal m aintenance decreased significantly with time. We think that the cause for this decrease is habituation to the wake-up sound. The word ¡°habituation¡± can be  defined as follows: ¡°if provided with the same stimulus repeatedly, the response to the stimulus decreases and disappears in the end.¡± Thus, we think that this habituation can be solved by switching the properties of the wake-up sound before habituation and that the botherati on of switching the properties of the wake-up sound can be solved by playing the sound for as long as possible before habituation occurs. Therefore, we conducted an experim ent to obtain the habituation times for sounds with different properties. METHODS In this experiment, participants listened to s ounds that changed their sound pressure level at intervals, and we evaluated the habituation according to whether they perceived the change. Experimental Task Experimental task involved listening to sounds that changed their sound pressure level at intervals using a headphone. The pa rticipants were asked to press the left arrow key if they perceived that the sound pressure  level decreased and the right ke y if they perceived that the sound pressure level increased. They were asked to  not press any key if they did not perceive a change in the sound pressure level. Particip ants wore eye m asks during the experim ent to prevent them from being affected by visual stimulation. Sounds Estimates were m ade of the habituation tim es for the steady running noise and the three wake-up sounds, whose ef fectiveness of arous al m aintenance had been validated by our previous experiments. The psychoacoustic parameters of each sound are listed in Table 1. ¨C Sound 1: Steady running noise at a speed of around 100 km/h. ¨C Sound 2: Reduce the sound pressure level of the frequency band of the road noise (100¨C500 Hz) by 6 dB. ¨C Sound 3: Raise the sound pressure level of the frequency band of the wind noise (1¨C5 kHz) by 6 dB.  ¨C Sound 4: Reduce the sound pressure level of the frequency band of the road noise  -7  -(100¨C500 Hz) by 6 dB and raise the sound pressure level of the frequency band of the wind noise (1¨C5 kHz) by 6 dB.

Measurements Task Score: The task score indicates the correct number of answers for an experimental task per one min. Skin Potential Response (SPR): The skin po tential response means the negative wave that occurs in response to a fluctuation in the sound pressure level. Participants The participants were twelve  men who had norm al hearing ability (age: 20¨C24 years). They gave written informed consent. Environment The experim ents were conducted in an  acous tic room  under the following cond itions: a temperature of 22¨C24 ¡ã C, humidity of 30¨C50% , CO 2 concentration of 500¨C1000 ppm , and illuminance of 1000 lux. Procedure First, the participant rests for 5 min with his eyes closing. N ext, the participant listens to the sounds for 13 min. The participants are habituated to the sounds in the first m in, and then the sounds fluctuate 120 times (a fluctuation of one time per 6 s, and 4 times in each fluctuant pattern) in the remaining 12 min. This experimental schedule is described in Fig. 6. 5 min. 13 min.RelaxSPRTaskTask Score Fig. 6 Experimental Schedule RESULTS Task Score Fig. 7 shows the average ratio of correct res ponses for every 30 s period. This result shows that the ratio of correct responses tended to decrease with time for every sound, and that the ratio of correct responses for Sound 3 or Sound 4 was higher than for Sound 1 or Sound 2 at a certain time, with around 0.6 of the tasks generating a correct response.  -8  -0.30.40.50.60.70.80.912 3 4 56 78 9 10 11 12Time [min.]Sound 1 Sound 4Sound 2 Sound 3Ratio of Correct Responses 0 Fig. 7 Task Score Skin Potential Response Fig. 8 shows the SPR score, which  represents the average am plitude value of the negativ e wave.

Sound 3 and Sound 4 are sounds that raise the acoustic pressure of the frequency ba nd of the wind noise by 6 dB. Therefore, the habituation can be suppressed by raising the acoustic pressure  of the frequency band of the wind noise. Additionally, the habituation time for each sound was determined based on the time when the task scores fell below 0.6. The habituation times for the sounds were Sound 1: 2.5 min, Sound 2: 2.5 min, Sound 3: 5.0 min, and Sound 4: 5.0 min.   -9  -CONSTRUCTION OF ANTI-HABITUATION SOUND Fig. 9 shows the construction of a sound that  prevents habituation. This sound (called anti-habituation sound) was constructed us ing four sounds: Sound 1, Sound 4, Sound 3, and Sound 2, which were switched in that order wh ile considering their habituation tim e. The switching order was determined by the rule that the sound that is played next should be vastly different in properties from the previous sound.

Fig. 9 Construction of Anti-habituation Sound  EVALUATION OF ANTI-HABITUATION SOUND METHODS Participants listened to a sound consisting of a processed steady running noise through speakers during a m onotonous driving task, and evaluated the sound¡¯ s ef fectiveness for arousal maintenance. Experimental Task The experimental task was the same as the experim ental task described in the evaluation of the wake-up sounds and music. Sounds The steady running noise and anti-habituation sound constructed in the previous chapter were evaluated for their effectiveness for arousal maintenance. ¡þ Sound A: Steady running noise at a speed of around 100 km/h. ¡þ Sound B: Anti-habituation sound. Measurements Subjective Assessment: When the sign ask ing them to assess their sub jective drowsiness is shown in the upper right on the display ev ery five m in, as illus trated in Fig.  10, the participants give their drowsiness level in five levels, ¡°Not Sleepy¡± to ¡°Very Sleepy.¡± 1Not Sleepy3Sleepy5Very Sleepy Fig. 10 Sign for Subject Assessment  Facial Expression Evaluation: An evaluator, who does not know the aim and content of the  - 10 -experiment, evaluates the drowsiness of the participant from an image of their face based on  the method of Kitajim a [6]. The e valuation standard in m ethod of Kitajim a consists of 5 categories: 1: Not Sleepy, 2: Slightly Sleepy, 3: Sleepy, 4: Rather Sleepy, 5: Very Sleepy. Task S core: The task s core is c alculated using the horizon tal distance between the  central sine curve and the circle on the d isplay. Specifically, the task score is  calculated using the square root of the sum of squares of the horizontal distance between the central sine curve and the circle on the display every millisecond, as described in formula (1).

This result reveals that the wake-up sound that was designed to prevent habituation can maintain an arousal state longer than the wake-up sound that was not designed to prevent habituation.  CONCLUSION In this paper, we addressed two issues. The first was whethe r wake-up sounds can m aintain their effectiveness for arousal m aintenance in an environm ent where music is p layed. The other issue was the ina bility of a wake-up sound to m aintain an arousal state for a suf ficient length of time for use in a real environm ent. We found that although li stening to music can maintain an arousal state for a while, liste ning to your favorite m usic and a wake-up sound simultaneously can m aintain an arousal st ate for m uch longer . Next, we focused on habituation to sound as the cause f or the decr ease in a wake-up sound¡¯ s effectiveness for arousal maintenance and constructed a sound that is difficult to be habituated to. As a result of evaluating a constructed sound¡¯ s ef fectiveness for arousal m aintenance, we found that a wake-up sound that takes m easures against hab ituation can m aintain an arousal state for a longer period than one that does not take such measures.

However, there has been no established way to evaluate visual awareness of a driver. We propose to utilize P300, which is a brain wave component and correlates with attention, as a basic indicator of visual awareness. Recently, a lot of techniques for analyzing P300 have been proposed both in basic and applied science. Though there have been many studies about P300, no studies have researched correlation between visual awareness and P300 in single trials. In this study, using these techniques such as xDAWN algorithm and support vector machine (SVM), a P300 classifier was constructed, which estimates visual awareness based solely on brain wave data in single trials. In order to test the classifier, a simple cognitive experiment, in which a subject was aware or unaware of visual threshold stimuli, was conducted. The result was that the classifier could estimate visual awareness of all three subjects with more than 95% accuracy, suggesting that the method and single-trial P300 can provide a promising way to evaluate drivers¡¯ visual awareness. In future, we are going to reveal the dynamics of rare driver errors, utilizing single-trial P300 as a basic indicator of awareness. The future work that has to be done for  2 real world application is discussed in this context.  KEYWORD Visual awareness, P300 classification, Single trial, EEG, ERP, Inattentive driving  INTRODUCTION Fatal car accidents caused by human errors and failures are an important issue in public security. They are mainly caused by the failure of the drivers to detect changes of traffic environments. In order to build an adaptive alarming system that provides appropriate information to the inattentive drivers, it is necessary for the alarming system not only to recognize potentially dangerous objects outside the car, but also to recognize drivers¡¯ visual awareness of them. To accomplish such a goal, as a first step, we have to construct a basic measure by which visual awareness is evaluated quantitatively. One of the psychophysiological indicators commonly investigated in relation to awareness is P300 (1, 2). P300 is a positive electroencephalogram (EEG) deflection maximal over the parietal cortex and elicited between 300-600ms after stimulus presentation that evokes attention. Generally, P300 is extracted and analyzed by averaging tens of EEG waves obtained through repeated trials in order to attenuate background noises. However, it is necessary to evaluate visual awareness in single trials in order to analyze rare driver¡¯s errors in detail individually. The ability to perform single-trial classification of P300 is an area of research that has recently received much attention. For example, single-trial classification techniques have allowed for the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) which can support communication abilities for physical disabled patients (3, for reviews see 4, 5). On the other hand, in basic research the ability to assess single-trial P300 could provide new insights into brain function (e.g. 6, 7).  Generally, single-trial classification is difficult due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of P300 embedded within other brain activities, muscular and ocular artifact. In order to enhance the SNR, several noise reduction methods have been applied, including principal component analysis (PCA) (8), wavelet transform (9), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) (10), common spatial patterns (CSP) (11), independent component analysis (ICA) (6, 12), xDAWN algorithm (13). In addition, several classification methods have been applied, including Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) (14), stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) (3, 15), Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) (13, 16), linear/non-linear support vector machines (SVM) (10, 17, 18). We have chosen xDAWN algorithm and linear SVM to construct a single-trial P300 classifier based on preceding  3 comparative studies (16, 19, 20) and our preliminary researches. Although there have been many studies about single-trial P300, no studies investigated relationship between awareness and P300 in single trials as far as we surveyed. In order to evaluate the capability of single-trial P300 as a basic indicator of drivers¡¯ visual awareness on the road, as a first step, we conducted a simple cognitive experiment in which dim visual threshold stimuli were presented to a subject. And we tested the performance of the single-trial P300 classifier to discriminate whether he was aware of the visual stimulus or not.  DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING EXPRIMENT Subjects We recruited 3 subjects with no history of neurological disturbance (mean age 27 years, 3 males). They all were healthy and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All the participants gave their informed consent before the experimental session begun.  Stimuli and procedure The subjects wore an electrodes headset (Easy cap) and were seated in a comfortable chair with a monitor at a distance of about 1 m in electrically and acoustically attenuated room as shown in Figure 1.                The task procedure is shown in Figure 2. The target stimulus was a gray circle (1.8¡ãin diameter; 7.85 cd/m2), presented on a gray background (7.25 cd/m2). It was presented in Figure 1. Experimental setup  4 target trials (33.3%) and not in no-target trials (66.7%). Each trial began with a black fixation cross in the center of the computer screen. After the fixation cross disappeared, the screen was blank for pseudo-random time period (500-1000 ms). And then the target stimulus was presented in the target trials. In the no-target trials, a blank screen was displayed instead of the target stimulus. They were followed by a blank screen for pseudo-random time period (1000-1500 ms) until a black question mark ¡°?¡± appeared, indicating that the response should be given. If the subject detected the target stimulus in the target trial, the duration of the stimulus was decreased with one screen refresh (10ms) in the next target trial. The duration of the blank screen in no-target trials varied according to the responses in target trials, but the responses in no-target trials did not affect the stimulus durations in target trials. Therefore the duration was adjusted to visual detection threshold of the subject. The subjects were asked to press the ¡°1¡± button if they consciously perceived the target stimulus, to press the ¡°3¡± button if they did not have a conscious perception and to press the ¡°2¡± button if they wonder whether it appeared. They were encouraged not to guess but to respond on the basis of their conscious visual experience. They were permitted to blink and move eyes freely during the trials. They performed 10 experimental blocks after 2 training blocks. Each block included 51 trials (17 target trials, 34 no-target trials). In the beginning of  the first block, the duration of the first target stimulus was 200ms. Each trial was pseudo-randomly ordered.             Data acquisition The equipment used for the EEG was recorded using 32 electrodes with international 10/20 system sites as shown in Figure 3. Nose channel was used as reference and an electrode at Afz were used as ground. EEG was amplified (SynAmps) using a band pass of 0.1¨C100 Hz, with the sampling rate of 250 Hz. The impedance of the electrodes was kept below 10 k Ohm through the experiment.   £«¡ñ£¿target trialResponse500¡«1000ms1000¡«1500ms1000msno-target trial £«1000mstimeFigure 2. Task design Dim visual threshold stimulus Fixation cross  5                    Event-related potential Brain wave form calculated by the traditional averaging technique is called event-related potential (ERP). ERP was calculated in order to analyze overall trend. EEG data at parietal channel (Pz) in target trials were averaged, time-locked to target stimulus onset (0ms). We excluded several trials, which are contaminated with ocular and muscular artifact, from averaging based on visual inspection. Before averaging, a 0.5-8Hz band pass filter was applied and baseline was corrected in the ¨C100 to 0ms.   PROCESSING AND CLASSIFICATION ¡°Aware trial¡± (target trial in which a subject detected a target stimuli and pressed ¡°1¡± button) and ¡°Unaware trial¡± (target trial in which a subject missed it and pressed ¡±3¡± button) were discriminated with the single-trial P300 classifier. We excluded ¡°Wonder trial¡± (target trial in which a subject was not sure about it and pressed ¡°2¡± button) from classification. Single trials of duration 1000ms were extracted from the data. Single trials started at target stimulus onset (0ms) and ended at 1000ms. Figure 4 is the diagram of the single-trial P300 classifier. Our algorithm consists of two phases: training phase and testing phase. The data obtained in target trials were divided into training data and testing data: 4 target trials for testing, others for training. And all data were tested in repeated procedure. For a subject, each xDAWN spatial filter and SVM model was  Figure 3. Electrode location  6 treated as a fixed one, which were obtained in training phase and used in testing phase.              Training phase The tasks of this phase are to obtain the xDAWN spatial filter U, to decide which features to use and to obtain SVM model. Training data were processed as illustrated in Figure 4 (a). Band pass filtering: Through spectrum analysis, we found that the principal energy of P300 was concentrated in the frequency band of 0.5-8Hz, so the raw data were passed through a 0.5-8Hz band pass filter.  xDAWN spatial filter training: xDAWN algorithm is specifically designed to enhance the SNR of P300 unlike other general method such as PCA and ICA. It automatically estimates P300 subspace from EEG data and output a spatial filter to enhance P300 signal (13). After band pass filtering, xDAWN algorithm was applied to the training data matrix X = {x1(t), x2(t),¡­,xn(t)}, where n denotes the number of channels and x denotes EEG data. Then xDAWN spatial filter U (n¡Án) was obtained. P300 enhanced matrix S = {s1(t), s2(t),¡­,sn(t)}, where s denotes an enhanced component, was obtained through following simple formula. UXS =                                   (i) Feature extraction: The enhanced matrix in a single trial consists of 32 components and 251 time points (0-1000ms, 250Hz). The enhanced matrix was decimated to 20Hz. They are used as features for a SVM model. Besides, additional features (spectrum power, template matching and statistical values) were calculated from EEG data at centroparietal channel (Pz). Spectrum power data were calculated by short-time Fourier transform at several frequencies (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20Hz and average of all frequency bands). Template matching values are cross-correlation/mean-square-error between a P300 template and EEG data calculated in moving window. The P300 templates were estimated by averaging the EEG data of all ¡°Aware trials¡±. Five templates, different in length (200/400/600ms) and averaging method (0ms/peak latency locked average), were used. Statistical values are Figure 4.

Totally, 103 features (32 components, 14 spectrum power, 10 template matching, 47 statistical values) were obtained. Feature selection & SVM training: Feature selection procedure was constructed based on  Rakotomamonjy and Guigue (18). Linear SVM was implemented with LIBSVM (21, 22). In order to lessen the number of feature and avoid over-fitting problem in SVM training, appropriate features were selected from 103 features by following recursive procedure.  First, a SVM was trained with all 103 features. The performance of the SVM model was evaluated according to accuracy of aware/unaware classification. Then, each single feature was temporarily removed, and the accuracy was re-evaluated. The feature whose removal had maximized the accuracy was definitely eliminated. The procedure was then continued until all channels had been eliminated. A feature set performed best accuracy in this procedure was selected for testing phase. In order to speed-up this elimination procedure, we have chosen remove 7 features at a time. SVM training was executed in above procedure. The value of the parameter C (Linear SVM parameter) were also decided in it, assessing the efficiency by cross-validation. Finally, xDAWN spatial filter U, a selected feature set and a SVM model were obtained  Testing phase First, testing data were passed through a 0.5-8Hz band pass filter. Then xDAWN spatial filter, selected feature set and SVM model, which are obtained in training phase, were applied to the data and visual awareness to the target stimulus were classified.   RESULT BEHAVIOR The behavioral results are shown in Table 1. No subjects pressed ¡°1¡± button in no-target trials, suggesting that they used a conservative criterion and pressed ¡°1¡± button only when they really subjectively saw the stimulus. There are fewer target trials (total: 115) for subject3 than subject1 and 2 (total: 163, 164) because he gave up the experiment halfway because of his sudden stomachache.         Table 1.

They show parietal centered activity at peak latency (Subject1: 444ms, Subject2: 520ms, Subject3: 460ms), which also corresponds to P300. These average results show the existence of the P300 when the subjects were aware of visual stimuli and the absence when they were not.                              -50510152025-0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1Time(sec)Amplitude(mV)-50510152025-0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1Time(sec)Amplitude(mV)Aware Trial (¡°1¡± button) Wonder Trial (¡°2¡± button) Unaware Trial (¡°3¡± button) Subject1 Subject2 20.8 -20.8 0 23.5 -23.5 0 Time = 444 ms Time = 520 ms (¦ÌV) (¦ÌV)  9               Single-trial analysis Classification result While averages show the correlation between P300 and visual awareness, we needed to discriminate the existence of visual awareness in single trials. The single-trial classification results are shown in Table 2. The classifier correctly discriminated ¡°Aware Trial¡± with 94.9%, ¡°Unaware Trial¡± with 97.5% accuracy and with 96.1% totally in average. This result is much better than other single-trial P300 study (e.g. 89% in (23)) although experimental settings are different.        CONCLUSION The single-trial P300 classifier we constructed correctly estimated the subjects¡¯ visual awareness with more than 96% accuracy. So it is suggested that the method and single-trial P300 provide a promising way to evaluate visual awareness. As next challenges, we test the method under more complicate circumstance such as a driving simulator and assess availability of the method for more realistic driving incidents. Then we are going to investigate relationship between driver errors and other physiological indicators that are more appropriate for commercial use, e.g. eye movement and body motion, utilizing single-trial -505101520-0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1Time(sec)Amplitude(mV) Table 2.

 DISSEMINATION OF INNOVATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES USING PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS MODEL Model Solutions for the Public Sector   Osama Elhamshary 1, Ph.D., P.E., PMP,  California Department of Transportation, Division of Program and Project Management 111 Grand Avenue - MS 7C, Oakland, CA, USA 94623 +1-916-947-5354 (Cell), E-mail: Oelhamshary@gmail.com   Submitted to the 18th World Congress on ITS in Orlando, Florida, October 16-20, 2011  ABSTRACT Today public agencies face substantial challenges when trying to deploy new innovative products with an Intellectual Property (IP) protection. The challenges range from negotiation procedures to technical dialogues, specifications and conditions that allow the transfer of IP to other suppliers. Also, the legislations' rules and legal barriers that prevent free transfer of IP to other users or potential private partners. Partners/collaborators, that could improve, develop or modify the originally produced innovation by the public sectors or at least provide a massive scale that supply with an economic value. The awareness of trends in technology and markets across wide range of sectors such as infrastructure, transportation, information systems, building materials, IT technologies will help test and verify contract and procurement performance. This understanding will enable the design and management of public private partnering as a model for procurement of innovation and deployment contracts. This paper examines key issues in the disseminations of innovation and new technology using public private partnerships as a model solution for public sector agencies. The paper presents and discusses the principles and addresses the major challenges as well as collaboration models for deployment of innovative products and technical procurement.  LIST OF KEY WORDS : Public Private Partnerships (PPP), Procurement of Innovations, Collaborations Models, Intellectual Property.  INTRODUCTION Historically innovation was thought of as a simple process of investment in fundamental research leading to commercialization of new products. This view was supported by supply-side policies. In today's world, innovation expands to a wide variety of sources and combines both demand and supply policies and perspectives. A number of typologies of public sector innovations have been proposed. The literature distinguishes at least four types of innovations: 1) Product Innovation, 2) Process Innovation, 3) Organizational Innovation, and 4) Marketing Innovation. The identification and procurement of innovative products or solutions by public agencies is an effective way to deliver improvement to the quality and delivery of services to the public. It is a way to assist the public sector in its commitment to achieve a long term value in goods and services with limited resources. Government agencies are major purchasers in many markets and also have a vital rule to structure market through contracting rules and regulations. The procurement contract is                                                  1 Dr. Elhamshary was serving as a Senior Development Engineer /Project Manager at University of California Berkeley on leave of absence from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). While working with the CA Center for Innovative Transportation at UC Berkeley he was charged with the deployment of Caltrans-funded research results in the areas of maintenance and safety equipment, system integration and travel information. a vehicle for public agencies to obtain services and products from an outside entity when staffs lack the expertise or knowledge to acquire, obtain, or perform these required tasks.  THE CHALLANGES OF PROCUREMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS FOR PUBLIC SERVICES The public sector is usually characterized as bureaucratic and not rewarding risk taking. However, records show that many key innovations came from the public sector such as the Internet, certain medical advances, social innovations such as e-voting and congestion management innovations. The challenges to apply innovative procurement of innovative products range from negotiation procedures, technical dialogue, specifications, and legal barriers and conditions that prevent free transfer of IP to other users or potential private partners or suppliers.  Procurement for innovation means the purchasing of goods or services that do not yet exist or that require new/additional features. Traditionally, there are three types of procurement: 1) Public procurement of innovative goods and services; 2) Pre-commercial procurement; and 3) Cooperative or catalytic procurement. In today's world, innovation expands to a wide variety of sources and combines both demand and supply policies and perspectives. Some governmental agencies have difficulty in standardizing bid documents and developing specifications for innovative goods and services. Or they add unnecessary details, which do not add value and complicate the procurement process and further delay the deployment. This paper argues that innovative procurement and partnerships are the vehicle to deliver and expand the benefits of already existing and shelved research and to deploy innovative technologies for the benefit of the public sector and other users. The identification and innovative procurement of products or solutions by public agencies is an effective way to improve the quality and delivery of services to the public. Partnerships are the way to assist the public sector in fulfilling its commitments, missions and goals and to achieve long-term social value. It also stimulates innovation within the economy and enables market research to respond to public service needs. This paper aims to provide a review and evaluation of the process of innovative public procurement and collaborative public-private partnerships (PPP) for policy makers, procurers and end users. In this respect, this paper strives to present lessons learned in the following two areas: Challenges of procurement of innovative products as well as opportunities in utilizing the PPP model to accelerate their deployment in the public sector. The paper discusses three issues: 1) Principles for development of successful PPPs to minimize procedural, organizational, and legal challenges of the procurement of innovative products, 2) The use of PPP model as innovative procurement to disseminate new technologies, and 3) Challenges of using PPP as an effective innovative procurement model for the public sector.   PPP AS A MODEL FOR COLLLABORATION TO ACCELERATE PROCUREMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS Government agencies are major purchasers in many markets and also have a vital role to structure markets through their contracting rules and regulations. Any effective operational strategy and concept for innovative procurement should focus on three elements: 1) To understand key regulations and  policies that control public agency procurement and collaborations for innovative products; 2) To present potential private sector collaborators with an overview of the public sector's (federal, state and local) perspectives and expectations for collaboration and procurement; 3) To educate public agency staff about critical issues with regard to procurement of innovative products. The paper will discuss several issues such as vendor selection and patent questions. A summary of the lessons learned and successful examples will be presented and discussed. There are three models that describe  collaborations principles for technical procurement and innovative products: 1) Transfer Model, where the public agency such as the Department of Transportation (DOT) develops a technology in-house and transfers the IP to a private sector collaborator for   future development, manufacturing, and distribution (for example safety and detection equipment or travel information system). This model raises several key issues regarding procurement for an innovative product, especially when it involves the issue of state-owned IP rights. The process is very complicated and time-consuming when issues such as licensing, royalties, fair market value, etc. are involved, which most of the state DOTs are not used to deal with. 2) Development Model, where the public sector provides significant resources and expertise such as funding, management, co-development, and assistance with operational studies and data input to private sector collaborators to support the private sector's development and deployment of new products. With this model, there are several concerns with single product vendors and soul source bidding. The selection of a soul source can present a problem if a company has only a single product line, or if it goes bankrupt, the innovative product will not get built and the public agency has to restart the lengthy process of finding another vendor. 3) Introduction Model, where the public sector supports the introduction of a collaborator's product. The public sector undertakes significant programmatic activities that demonstrate and communicate the benefit of a product produced by a private sector collaborator. It is important to understand that the public sector/DOTs must make it attractive for companies to develop, built, deploy, and sell products and to be able to make profit.   A successful conceptual model of innovation in a public sector organization can be the establishment of a consortium of ¡°PPPs¡±, such as the Pooled Fund concept, of all interested partners/customers.  The idea is to generate public sector resources from multiple agencies that are interested in taking advantage of opportunities offered through groups to procure innovative products. For example, establish a national program/consortium that includes all end users, public agencies (DOTs, local government including cities and municipalities) the  private sector, universities and research centers to promote new safety equipment technology. However, it is crucial to understand that forming PPPs has often been more time consuming than originally anticipated. It might require a paradigm shift in the attitude and way of thinking for all partners. One of the reasons is that public and private entities have different objectives and concerns about sharing information and that private sector depends on the concept of profit maximization, while the public sector mission is social welfare for the society. Recently, public agencies have gained a better understanding of the private sector's role in forming PPPs. It is critical that the partnership be tailored to the particular project of concern to accelerate the process and minimize the challenges of the procurement in term of process, organizational framework, and legal responsibility.  SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS A summary of the opportunities and challenges of innovative product procurement along with examples and case studies will be presented. The need for PPP as a model for innovative procurement in other sectors has long been established and demonstrated by public sector agencies through their enthusiastic adoption of partnerships. Successful implementation of such a model in the transportation industry and public agencies will largely depend on the paradigm shift in the attitude and way of thinking of all partners. This will rely heavily on  the transparent collaboration, selection of the appropriate collaborator model, proper risk management, awareness of potential interests and conflicts, comprehensive and effective treatment of the intellectual property, liability conditions and contract scope, content and duration. And finally, how the PPP will ensure high standards of quality and ethics.

The closed, isolated nature of these systems enabled the ITS network to avoid existing IT security issues and policies. Typically, these systems were dominated by low bandwidth, serial communication technology in concert with analog signal transmission for closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs). With the emergence of Ethernet/Internet Protocol (IP) networks, cost efficient high quality digitized video, and a desire to share data with partner agencies, ITS networks transitioned from segregated networks to merged networks where IT professionals, ITS engineers, and transportation managers find themselves working hand in hand toward similar objectives. This paper explores the challenges, successes, and lessons learned from real world ITS/IT collaborations.   CASE STUDY: CITY OF CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA  The Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT) developed their original ITS Communications Master Plan in October 2004 and updated the document in 2008. The updated document provides a roadmap for the conversion of the ITS network from serial to IP/Ethernet communications concurrent with a transition from an analog to a digital video format. Funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allowed CDOT to move forward with the U-5133 Part A Intelligent Transportation System project beginning in January 2010, which provided a means for implementation of those objectives outlined in the ITS Master Plan. In 2009, CDOT had begun a partnership with the City¡¯s IT department to fund an IT position to provide network expertise for the CDOT transportation system. Given the closed, stand-alone nature of the network previous to U-5133A, the IT department had not been involved in the development of either the Master Plan or the Master Plan Update. The magnitude of the U-5133A project coupled with the IT department¡¯s perception of appropriate network architecture and security presented several challenges to the partnership. While the City¡¯s IT department is most familiar with networks inside buildings with limited -2- access to field deployed equipment hardware, CDOT¡¯s network spans the City and is susceptible to unconditioned environments and construction elements. What¡¯s more, while only IT staff typically configure and install equipment within the City network, CDOT technicians and contractors have access to traffic equipment cabinets where network switches reside. Maintenance of the network is also an issue, as CDOT staff need to be able to replace defective switches, but the IT department has concerns about providing configuration information because of security protocols. Due to these operations, maintenance, and security issues, the IT department was initially reluctant to concur on design and allow the accessibility required by CDOT. However, these issues are being resolved through persistent, thoughtful collaboration between the two entities. The IT staff have been instrumental and active participants in the design process for the network architecture, and CDOT has formulated a protocol with IT for maintenance of switches with pre-programmed configuration cards. The two departments now hold weekly meetings together to discuss staffing and workload priorities as equal partners. Conversations are being held between the two entities to determine the intelligent transportation system¡¯s limitations for connections to the City Enterprise network. Because of the willingness of the agencies to cooperate on these issues, obstacles are being surpassed and the project is moving forward. This is an ongoing collaboration and partnership which, if successful, will provide the City with a recipe for success as they seek to stay on the forefront of technological advances in the management of their networks.   Currently, CDOT and the City IT Department have formalized their collaboration through a memorandum of understanding that has placed an IT position within CDOT that is funded by CDOT.  This position has allowed for previously unprecedented integration within the City¡¯s mainstream IT policies.  This has included collaboration of network maintenance, network security, and workstation and server maintenance.  Also through this collaboration, CDOT has accelerated it¡¯s transition from an isolated, serial/analog based networkto an enterprise IP/Ethernet based network.  This has further enhanced CDOT¡¯s partnership with the Police Department and the North Carolina Department of Transportation, but also opened up opportunities with the Transit and Fire departments.    This collaboration is creating a platform for success for the completion of CDOT¡¯s IP conversion, as well as the procurement and implementation of a multi-department CCTV digital video platform that will permit the sharing of CCTV unit video from CDOT, the Police Department, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation through the City of Charlotte enterprise network as well as with trusted partners.

Historically, the City¡¯s traffic signal system was an isolated network running over twisted pair copper cabling. Following the 9/11 tragedy, the County sought to enhance its traffic management capabilities, and deployed CCTV cameras utilizing DSL over copper technologies as well as hybrid communications using Department of Technology Services points of presence. Following, the County Department of Environmental Services (DES) completed its first ITS communications master plan which laid out ITS device deployments and communications routing in a multi-year/multi phase program to port the County¡¯s ITS network to a fiber optic based system. Initially, the upgraded system was intended to be isolated and exclusive as the previous network was.  However, jurisdictional authority issues began to emerge between the Department of Technology Services (DTS) and DES which slowed progress on the design and deployment of the ITS communications upgrades. What followed were a series of high level management discussions that resulted in a collaborative approach for the funding, deployment, and operation of an optical, IP/Ethernet network. This immediate realization of the potential for pooled resources enabled both entities to combine their resources and the ITS master plan has been used as the basis of a County-wide communications master plan that aligns needs, funding, and priorities at a global level.  Resultant from this effort has been the resumption of phase 1 and the design and programming of future phases are underway.  This collaboration has had several fruitful outcomes.  These have included:  1. Development of a phased, enterprise master plan that leverages elements of the ITS communications deployments, deployments funded by public safety homeland security grant monies, and planned County financed communications plant deployment. 2. A coordinated network management strategy that preserves the DES traditional role in field equipment maintenance, while leveraging the DES skills in advanced network management. 3. Creation of a shared layer 3 core infrastructure that facilitates a dual homed/mesh fault tolerance to all edge devices n both the traffic and municipal services enterprise. 4. The utilization of conditioned environment County facilities to allow for enhanced function/reduced cost layer network equipment. 5. Coordinated policies across departments to build communications conduit and fiber as part of major projects requiring major new utility installations or utility relocations.  By only paying the marginal cost to install conduit and fiber into an already open trench, the County has been able extend it conduit and fiber plant at substantially reduced costs. 6. The hiring of a contract staff member to coordinate communications project scoping, design, and installation across departments to insure the coordinated deployment of the County¡¯s unified communications master plan.  Figure 3 depicts the unified communications infrastructure master plan.  Table 1 depicts a proposed prioritization approach presented to the County for consideration. -5- Figure?3.??DTS?Enterprise?Communications?Physical?Plant?Master?Plan?Figure???Table?1.??Arlington?County?Communications?Plan?Prioritization?Table??-6-   CASE STUDY: MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION  The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is mainly concerned with operation, construction, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure, while the Department of Technology, Management and Budget (DTMB) is tasked with managing the technology infrastructure throughout the state. In the past, communication between MDOT and DTMB has not led to a favorable partnership between the two entities. Inefficiencies surrounding network issues and software licenses have been a major obstacle, and in many cases, ITS user needs have been disregarded in favor of pre-existing policies. MDOT previously managed deployments for all ITS networks with little assistance from other entities and was reluctant to ask for support with these tasks. However, MDOT and DTMB have been merging support efforts, where MDOT has utilized DTMB staff for IT management. This partnership was further advanced in their joint partnership to deploy a next-generation, statewide, Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS). DTMB includes numerous professionals who are knowledgeable in the ever-changing and advancing field of network communications and software development, and MDOT is pleased to have found a partnership that can add value to their technical knowledge base of transportation expertise. DTMB has proven to be an essential partner for the project as they are managing all servers, communications, and third-party licenses for the system. New DTMB management has been included in all ITS meetings to ensure project awareness. The agencies are working together successfully with their vendor to move forward and deploy the first phase of the project in May 2011.     CASE STUDY: CITY OF GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA  In 2006, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and the City of Greensboro Department of Transportation (GDOT) kicked off the Greensboro Computerized Traffic Signal System Rehabilitation and Expansion Design project. Previously, the City had a closed, copper system that utilized serial communication. However, the proposed design of a fiber optic network would facilitate conversion to IP/Ethernet communications as well as provide a fault tolerant ring/mesh architecture. The City of Greensboro Management Information Systems (MIS) Department had a franchise agreement with a local utility company for their network communications. The agreement allows the City to enjoy voice and data communications services at low cost. However, the agreement is due to expire and the City¡¯s telecommunications cost is expected to rise steeply as a result. Upon notification of GDOT¡¯s project, MIS pursued a partnership with GDOT and NCDOT. Given the IP/Ethernet framework and the department¡¯s extensive plans for deployment throughout the City, MIS would be able to access most City facilities with some small additions to the network. One challenge facing the collaboration involved the method of funding MIS additions to the network. This was effectively resolved by dividing the initial project into two projects. The first would comprise a GDOT/NCDOT funded project with extensive deployment of fiber optic communications that serviced all traffic devices. The second project was funded by MIS and solely included design to provide additional fiber optic cable and connections to all MIS buildings. Another obstacle involved bandwidth, as a 10 GB backbone ring would be required to provide fault tolerance to the MIS network while only a 1GB backbone was required to service the traffic enterprise. Fortunately, the MIS department was able to provide -7- funding to cover the additional cost of high bandwidth equipment. GDOT also benefited from the partnership as they were given the opportunity to use MIS buildings for environmentally controlled hub sites and also will be provided with MIS system maintenance and expertise. Scheduled to be completed by 2012, the system will serve as an efficient model for other municipalities within the state.  Figure 4 presents the overall 150 mile fiber optic touting.  Figure 5 presents an expanded quadrant view depicting MIS facilities and GDOT assets.  Figure?4.??Combined?Greensboro?DOT/MIS?IP/Ethernet?Network??Figure?5.??Expanded?Greensboro?MIS?Facilities?and?DOT?Assets?(MAP?A)??-8- ?CONCLUSION  The transition of ITS communications to IP/Ethernet based networks and the mainstreaming of ITS central hardware and software into the agency IT programs has brought its share of challenges. However, this convergence also affords ITS deployment operators and maintainers the opportunity to leverage the skills, expertise, and standardized maintenance and equipment replacement cycles typical IY departments.  Likewise, this convergence provides IT departments access to high bandwidth communications networks and shared mission software platforms.  Additionally, ITS operators and maintainers often bring decades of physical infrastructure construction and maintenance experience.  While developing common operating, security, and maintenance policies can be challenging, benefits of collaboration include:  ¡þ Shared use of staff resources, leveraging specialists and reducing staff duplication ¡þ Shared use of equipment procurement vehicles and service agreements ¡þ Reduced leased communications costs ¡þ Standardized software development and procurement practices ¡þ Increased opportunities to leverage grants and funding opportunities across an entire enterprise   ?

Besides identifying crash hot spots which merit further investigation, and prioritizing them for potential safety improvements, Plan4Safety integrates statewide crash data and roadway characteristic data, calculates statistical analyses, incorporates network screening layers and models, offers a diagnosis and countermeasures tool based on FHWA best practices, prioritizes countermeasures using economic analysis methods, proposes safety countermeasure post-evaluation and includes a visual analytical tool (GIS). These tools were developed with safety professionals¡¯ needs in mind and allow the user to hone in on problem areas so that site-specific improvements can be implemented. The software also contains essential tools for examining incident patterns and properties. NJDOT, metropolitan planning organizations (MPO), county and local engineers, and other decision makers can all use Plan4Safety to help resolve critical issues and assess the most sound and cost-effective ways to approach safety management, enhancement, and improvement.  The program was built in layers. Plan4Safety houses the crash database provided by the NJDOT from the year 2003 to the most recent available. The program incorporates 144 distinct pieces of data per crash from the NJTR-1 crash report form. Although no personal information is included to protect those involved in vehicular crashes, data includes an array of items such as crash type, severity, driver age and gender, location, and vehicle types.   Currently, four layers are presented to the user for crash data retrieval and analysis. Layers 5 and 6 will be available in the near future.   LITERATURE REVIEW  CRASH ANALYSIS SOFTWARE TOOLS  A very detailed list of the current crash analysis software tools is presented in the report by Brown et al. (1), which was done by reviewing software and agency web sites and surveying state safety engineers.   By comparing Plan4Safety with other transportation safety tools, it is understood that three major preferences distinct Plan4safety from others:  ¡þ The GIS component of Plan4Safety provides mapping visualization and analysis capabilities. Crash locations for all crashes or specific situations can be viewed. Plan4Safety utilizes spatial components primarily provided by ESRI, but also integrates some mapping capabilities offered for free by Google Maps and allows Plan4Safety to provide powerful GIS functionality over the internet.  ¡þ Plan4safety has some analytical tools in network screening layer which are specifically used in New Jersey. BSP analytical methodologies which are applied by safety traffic engineers in Bureau of Safety Program (BSP) at the NJDOT is an example of such tools. Also High Risk Road Segments analysis tool compares particular roadway (interested road) with another roadway as a reference route. In addition to those tools, Plan4safety has some conventional methodologies to rank crash sites like crash rate, critical crash rate, severity rate and critical severity rate. - 3 -   ¡þ The third major preference is the web-based nature of that Plan4safety. The basic design on a web application is that the application sits on a web server, and all users will access to it via a web browser over the internet. This means that configuration and deployment is limited only to the web server, so management is much easier. Being a web based application, Plan4Safety can reach many users who have access to the web and a compatible web browsers. The advantages of web based applications are mobility, ease of access, distribution, configuration management and maintenance. New Jersey has 300,000 crashes on average per year, so in order to save them in computer for like 5 or 6 years, it uses considerable amount of the memory of the PC.  RESOURCES FOR ANALYTICAL METHODS  Since the main targets of Plan4Safey are NJDOT safety engineers and planners, many of analytical methods used in this program try to automate NJDOT-standardized procedures. Crash site ranking methods are extracted from New Jersey 5 percent report documented in 2008.   The methodology introduced by Harwood et al. (2) and equations of Highway Safety Manual (HSM) (3) are used to model and implement the Safety Performance Function calculation procedure. The calibration method to adjust results to New Jersey area, and appropriate Accident Modification Factors are also derived from HSM (3).  In Diagnosis and Countermeasure layer, several resources of proven, tested or experimented safety countermeasures for rear-end, left-turn and pedestrian-involved crash types at signalized and non-signalized intersections and roadway segments are used. (4), (5), (6). For Accident Modification Factors, (7), (8), (9) are used.  In Economic Analysis layer, NJDOT methodologies for countermeasure evaluation and ranking as well as methodologies introduced in HSM (3) are used.   PLAN4SAFETY LAYERS  LAYER 1 - DATA PREPARATION AND INTEGRATION  Layer 1 is composed of simple analytical functions such as frequency analysis, cross tab generator, trend line, road histogram, and viewing/exporting crash reports. It has basic functionalities, including extraction and organization of crash data.   Frequency analysis function evaluates the crash data and provides the frequency or distribution of a variable. The output includes the frequency, percentage and their cumulative values. A case study is done in order to evaluate the crash data for Middlesex County, New Jersey for drivers older than 35 years old from year 2006 to 2008. For this case, frequency analysis was performed and the result shown in Figure 1. - 4 -   Figure 1. Frequency analysis case study output  Cross tab creates tables of the filtered crash data with desired column and row headings chosen from data table columns. It enables choosing several parameters as column or row headings, thus grouping the data with respect to these parameters. Table 1 indicates the results of the case study done in order to create cross-section table for Middlesex County in New Jersey for drivers older than 35 years old from year 2006 to 2008 using cross tab analysis. In this case, crash type and crash year were chosen as row heading and column heading respectively.  Table 1. Cross tab analysis case study output  Trend line function gives the trend of five different parameters for filtered crash data: total killed, total injured, pedestrians killed, pedestrians injured, and number of crashes. It fits a linear trend line to the selected parameter for user¡¯s desirable time interval. Figure 2 shows the output of the case study done using trend line analysis for total injured people due to crashes in Middlesex County, New Jersey for drivers older than 35 years old from year 2006 to 2008. In this case study the starting date and ending date are 12/31/2005 and 12/31/2008 and interval is 30 days. - 5 -   Figure 2. Trend line case study output  Road Histogram divides a roadway into equal length segments and gives the frequency of crashes in each segment; thus building a histogram. The user has options to choose the years to include segment length, start and end mileposts.  For instance, in order to view the road histogram for US Highway 1 in Middlesex County, New Jersey from Milepost 12 to 16 for drivers older than 35 years old from year 2006 to 2008, road histogram analysis was performed and the results are shown in Figure 3. In this case study the segment length is 0.5 miles. The horizon axis is the milepost and the vertical axis is the number of the crashes.  Figure 3. Roadway histogram case study output  LAYER 2 - GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)  The GIS component of Plan4Safety provides mapping visualization and analysis capabilities.  Crash locations for all crashes or specific filters can be viewed. Plan4Safety utilizes spatial components primarily provided by ESRI, but also integrates some mapping capabilities offered for free by Google Maps. GIS has three distinct map views: the state GIS map, an ESRI Street Map, and ORTHO aerial images. Figure 4 illustrates a snapshot of GIS used in Plan4Safety for a filtered location. - 6 -    Figure 4. A snapshot of GIS for a selected location  LAYER 3 - NETWORK SCREENING   In the Network Screening Layer, higher analysis and evaluation tools, such as high risk road segment, intersection model, crash rate model, cluster finder, Safety Performance Function calculator, etc., help identifying high-incident sites, on a macro level (state, county) or micro level (city, roadway) and ranking crash sites-a critical function that allows decision makers to prioritize and proactively address potential problem areas. Layer 3 of Plan4Safety integrates computer models applying all common methodologies used in New Jersey and other states. In addition, network screening can indicate the likelihood of crashes in particular areas, which can be used for future evaluations. Using the crash rate and intersection model in Layer 3, FHWA-approved diagnoses and countermeasures are provided to the user in Layer 4. The followings are several case studies performed using Layer 3 functionalities.  High risk road segment methodology compares a particular roadway with another roadway as a reference. Each segment in the interested roadway is compared with the homogenous roadway segments in the reference route. The segments with the higher number of crashes than homogenous segments in the reference road are highlighted as ¡°Over¡± which stands for over represented segment. Table 2 shows the output of the case study performed using high risk road segment for New Jersey Route 18 and considering US Highway 1 as the reference, both in Middlesex County, New Jersey.  - 7 -   Table 2. High risk road segment case study output  Cluster finder is a function that finds crash ¡°hot spots¡± based on the area the user defines. It allows the user to determine the cluster length and define the minimum number of clusters and weigh the clusters based on severity and can specify the collision type and sort them by number of crashes or SRI and milepost. Cluster finder analysis was performed for crashes in Middlesex County, New Jersey, involving drivers older than 35 years old for all collision types from year 2006 to 2008 and the results are shown in Table 3.  Table 3. Cluster finder case study output  Crash rate is calculated by the number of crashes per million vehicles for intersections (MVMT), and crashes per million vehicles traveled per mile for roadway segments. Therefore, MVMT is estimated from the Average Annual Daily Traffic and length of roadway segments. Table 4 shows the output results of the case study done in order to prioritize crash sites based on crash rates in US Highway 1 in Middlesex County for drivers older than 35 years old from year 2006 to 2008. - 8 -   Table 4. Crash rate case study output  LAYER 4- DIAGNOSIS AND COUNTERMEASURES  The objective of Diagnosis and Countermeasure selection layer is to diagnose the problems of the hot spots based on the site characteristics and present an array of countermeasures to improve safety in the selected site. Based on the crash type, a tree structured questionnaire is proposed to the user. The questions are generally about traffic control devices, intersection/roadway geometry and traffic volume data of the selected site. Depending on the user¡¯s responses, one path of the tree structure is followed to a dead end where the potential problem is recommended, followed by the suitable solutions.  The output data in this approach contain the potential problem, the suitable solution, approximate implementation time and cost of the solutions, applicable areas, and the Accident Modification Factor (AMF).  To perform a case study, suppose that the intersection show in Figure 5 is selected for further analysis.  - 9 -   Figure 5. Selected intersection for further analysis using Layer 4  Then, the system will suggest the user to choose Same Direction-Rear End crash type, since it is the most frequent crash type at the intersection. This step is shown in Figure 6.   Figure 6. Recommended crash type by the system for further analysis  The results of diagnosis and countermeasure analysis for the specific intersection are shown in Figure 7.   Figure 7. Diagnosis and countermeasure case study output  - 10 -  LAYER 5 - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS  Economic analysis layer utilizes and evaluates the intersection model, high risk road segment and diagnosis and countermeasures proposed in Layer 4 and determines the most promising alternatives that maximize safety benefits given a budgetary constraint for the user. So far, three methodologies have been implemented in Plan4Safety, two of which are used in NJDOT for economic analysis of countermeasures. These methodologies are:  ¡þ Net Present Value  ¡þ Benefit/Cost Ratio  ¡þ Cost-Effectiveness Index  The user can select one (or more) of these methods for analysis.  LAYER6 ¨C POST-EVALUATION  In Post evaluation layer, the objective is to estimate the safety effect of countermeasures implemented by applying a before-after analysis on the number of crashes considering crash severity levels.  CONCLUSIONS  Plan4Safety is a tool that provides a myriad of benefits for safety professionals in New Jersey. Its advantages over similar tools include web-based platform, advanced wizard-based interface, containing NJDOT methodologies for safety purposes, and the user friendly GIS environment. Besides identifying crash hot spots which merit further investigation, and prioritizing them for potential safety improvements, Plan4Safety integrates statewide crash data and roadway characteristic data, calculates statistical analyses, incorporates network screening layers and models, offers a diagnosis and countermeasures tool based on FHWA best practices, prioritizes countermeasures using economic analysis methods, proposes safety countermeasure post-evaluation and includes a visual analytical tool (GIS).    Plan4Safety has the capability to integrate with various databases and programs, e.g. Emergency Management System, Pavement Management System, Drainage Management System, NJDOT Weather Stations, Census Database, NJDOT Pedestrian Sidewalk Inventory, etc. to be more effective and unite traffic safety with other areas in the future.    - 11 -  REFERENCES  1.

President, ITS Argentina Per¨² 247 2? C, (ZIP:C1067AAE) Buenos Aires, Rep¨²blica Argentina Phone/Fax: 0054 11 4331 2099 Email: daniel.russomanno@itsargentina.org.ar       Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -2-   Transportation Technology at People?s Service  Introduction Today, in our country, the success of the model of economic development implemented and the needs and social aspirations that has entailed, together with population growth, led (and will lead) to, among other consequences, a large increment in the mobility of citizens and assets. However, economic growth and mobility solutions do not seem to converge towards a sustainable scenario if we do not elaborate, precisely, a sustainable plan. And no plan will be sustainable if it does not include ITS technology!  In terms of Mobility, problems in the quality of life and the balanced development of the society, are important and diverse:  . Lack of a rational urban plan that takes into account the matrix of trips between origin and destination (2). . Increase of travel time. . The economic costs that result from using private transport instead of public, and the apparent preference of people to use their car.   . The difficulties and, in many cases, complete lack of special access to public transport for people with special needs: children, elderly, etc. . Lack of road safety due to inefficient infrastructure, urban or interurban. . Damage to public health arising from environmental pollution (gases and noise) and the degradation of the environment from emissions of pollutants. . The stress caused by traffic congestion. . Lack of energy rationalization and predominance of vehicles with fuel-based propulsion and not renewable energies. . The uncertainty of the user about road conditions or travel times, etc. Aware of the seriousness of the situation, we must pay attention to the problem by proposing new policies, strategies and plans and by putting into practice solutions with a systemic vision, that contribute to the development of a new sensibility and to a change in culture and attitudes. It is true that new initiatives will produce new challenges: that is why the design of sustainable solutions requires short, medium and long-term approaches and prospective studies.        Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -3-  It is a task that transforms infrastructure, people?s habits and patterns of economic development. The need of mobility obeys to various causes and produces effects, so it should be analyzed comprehensively: urban models, lifestyles, travel, economy, risk, social and political situation, the specific circumstances of people, the way of transport of people and goods and the quality of the solutions in terms of efficiency, safety and comfort. However, it should also take into account global trends in mobility concerning the next 15 or 20 years: . The cities will become more pedestrian.  . A model of flat and extensive urban development will not be compatible with sustainable mobility solutions. . The need of proximity between personal residences and workplaces and schools will be enhanced. . The quality, versatility and accessibility of public transport will be the main catalyst for the necessary cultural change. . The public transport system called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT's) will be part of the high-capacity and collective mobility solutions. . The bicycle will play a complementary role (but only complementary) in urban mobility. . Road safety is and will be a key to the widespread use of bicycle in routes close to different centers. . Achieving accessibility will require the collaboration of all of us, and citizens? sensitivity will act as a driving force.          . All initiatives will help to reduce the intensity of mobility and to increase efficiency by providing energy and environmental sustainability.        Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -4-  . The vehicles will be electrically powered. . Freight logistics will be based on shared strategies of planning and on innovative and creative business models. . The roads and underground tunnels are and will be crucial in urban areas, especially where no or partially developed (eg. Buenos Aires). . The grades crossing at railroads will cease to exist.  . The discussion on public transport will be focused on a strategy to improve the network as a whole, and not on specifics means of transport.  . ITS technology will (as always, in continuous transition) allow an intelligent management of infrastructure in favour of safety and mobility. In certain circumstances the instructions of ITS will prevail over the driver actions, and will help to regulate the environment of the city and to improve the efficiency and flow of people and goods (eg. ITS Cooperative Systems). For these reasons, today we cannot ignore the international technology called ITS, which are IT and Communication Technologies applied to transportation, to improve mobility of people, vehicles and goods that facilitate the convergence economic development models with sustainable mobility solutions.  There are several excellent technology solutions, with a great cost-benefit relation, urban and interurban, to improve traffic and transportation. But all these projects require not only technological knowledge of what to do, but how to do it.  These concepts have be clear in all phases of an ITS project, with objectives chosen from a smart approach. They should be: specific, measurable, ambitious, achievable and with a time horizon: from its planning throughout its design, installation, commissioning, maintenance, operation, and even its removal.   In each phase, it must be done what is called a virtuous cycle of Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Analyzing, pursuing continuous improvement through real       Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -5-  performance indicators, with proven effectiveness in measuring these indicators, because if the perception of a project is different from reality, we would be falling into a naive optimism that damages the ITS project and, therefore, the Company that should benefit from it.  In each task mentioned (PBMI), aims should be determined with the intelligent criterion mentioned before, but not just the project?s, but the aims of the people who work on each individual task: workers, technical professionals, managers and inspectors, and government officials. This circular procedure must be support by a good management, in order to improve the quality, tending to the best practices possible.  These objectives should be based, at least, on times, costs, user satisfaction and quality.  Moreover, you should identify, measure, analyze and control various key performance indicators (KPIs) for each phase of the ITS project, such as: Improvement of travelling times, Reduction of the number of road accidents and incidents, Reduction of costs for road accidents lawsuits, Reduction of environmental pollution, Reduction of energy consumption, Reduction of the MTBF (mean       Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -6-  time between failures of equipment or systems), Reduction of the number of claims for ITS system failures due to lack of maintenance or improper operation, Improvement of the service level, TMDA, TIR, VAN and others. With the KPI goals and KPI real values achieved there should be built a balanced scorecard and a big picture to control the gaps, so that the project management can use them to achieve the objectives.  Example of Balanced Scorecard and Key Performance Indicators:          Injuries Quantity             Process  Injuries     FCE N? 19    Indicator Accidents Quantity    Unit  n    Responsibile Transportation Dpt.

It also necessary to be consistent with the  model of country wanted, to take into account global trends in transport and technology and to make the respective risk analysis, with their probabilities of occurrence and impact, and the measures planned to be taken to mitigate these fully identified and classified risks. With those tools, there should be made a related SWOT analysis.          Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -8-   Goals should be clearly defined for all project levels and hierarchies, and should be evaluated during and at the end of the project by establishing the necessary corrections to cyclical variations.  It is well known that there are numerous failures in the implementation of projects and, especially, in IT projects. It is a fact that 31% of projects are cancelled before completion, only 16% are completed on time and on budget and the remaining 53% are completed with cost overruns and / or out of term and / or with less functionality (Source: The Chaos Report, The Standish Group, 1995). The three major success factors of an ITS project are: user involvement, management support and clear statement of requirements, while the three major factors of failure are: incomplete requirements, lack of user involvement and lack of available resources.  The state of the local and international market, the national degree of commercial protectionism and local business culture, etc., are also important subjects (3).           Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -9-   Scope of an ITS project (4)    The project scope is everything that must be done and, for that, it is necessary to establish real needs, understand stakeholders requirements and use the lessons learned.  The scope statement is a written description of the work required to implement the project. It provides a documented basis for decision-making and for the project team/stakeholders to develop and achieve a common understanding about the extent of it, including a detailed work structure.  Management of time is the hallmark of the projects. Therefore, specific techniques and elements have been developed, such as: Technical networks or critical path methods, PERT, GANTT. Diagrams, events or milestones, and implementation of the Monte Carlo method (statistical simulation) to estimate the duration.  The estimation of costs can be made as an estimate of the magnitude order  (analogous estimating), also called "top-down", or as a budget (parametric model) or as a detailed estimate (Final), calculating the costs of individual work packages, adding or moving up the individual estimates, to obtain the total project or bottom-to-top (bottom-up).  With the project schedule and the necessary resources to complete each task, it is determined when they are needed and, with the valuation of the cost of each resource, the "Performance Measurement Baseline" can be determined.  To follow the project development different performance indicators are used, such as physical progress actually achieved, Value of work done, and Budgeted Cost of Work Done. The tools of project management must necessarily apply to all ITS systems, such as: Arterial management, Freeway management, Traffic management, Incident management, Emergency management, Electronic toll collection, Traveller information, Ticketing, Information management, Crash prevention and safety, Roadway operations and maintenance, Road weather management, Commercial Vehicle Operations, Intermodal freight, Collision Avoidance Systems, Collision Information Systems, Driver Assistance Systems, etc. We can add to these the management systems of rail and maritime transport, while air transport systems are not considered conventional in this classification because they have peculiar procedures and characteristics. The ITS?s are designed to optimize the performance of existing transport infrastructure, trying to preserve the capacity and improving safety, reliability and mobility. The benefits of using ITS are quantifiable and result in improved road safety, mobility, productivity, efficiency, quality and customer satisfaction, lower power consumption, environmental pollution and costs.       Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -10-  And how do we evaluate an ITS system? (5) . With a feedback mechanism to ensure that the goals and objectives are met. . Keep in mind that the assessment is not a scorecard but a process. . It is necessary to report successes and failures, strengths and weaknesses, as you learn from errors. . In evaluating the system, the State should promote research and deployment of ITS, promote common standards and architecture, performing the role of a critic, monitoring the spread of STIs in deployment, integration and interoperability. It should determine costs and benefits and share the results. In this way, the impact will be understood, the benefits quantified. It will help the decision-making about future investments, optimize the operation system and / or design and improve the transportation system. The level of assessment required depends on the maturity of technology, assessment objectives, scale of the project and requirements of the sponsoring agencies. The steps for an efficient evaluation are to team up with technical expertise and leadership, to develop an evaluation strategy, a plan for evaluation and test plans, data collection and analysis, and to prepare a Report.  The report must contain performance indicators (KPI's) and should clearly indicate the goals (quantifiable) and objectives, be simple, easy to understand, logical and reliable, indicate trends, identify issues without ambiguity, allow the collection of economic data, be bounded in time and allow to make sensitivity analysis.  National ITS Architecture: Now is the time! Increased demand for mobility must necessarily produce a change in road infrastructure.  People do not only have their home as origin and destination, but multiple trips for various activities.  For loads, the transition from a "stock" to a "flow" economy, the relocation of production facilities and market size have increased the importance and complexity of the transport chain and logistics process. Forecasts indicate that traffic flows will grow in the coming years, with negative consequences for the environment, quality of life, road safety and for the whole economy of our country.  As shown by the international experiences, to meet the challenges of growing demand for mobility is necessary to adopt a systemic approach, in which information,       Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -11-  management and control operate in synergy to optimize the use of infrastructure, vehicles and logistics platforms with a multimodal perspective.  Intelligent transport systems play a role in this strategic approach Indeed, the ITS, based on the interaction between Information Technology and Telecommunications Transportation can transform an "integrated system" in which traffic flows are distributed equally among the different modes for efficiency, productivity and, above all, safety.  The exercise of the systems so far made, both urban and interurban, has allowed an assessment of tangible benefits provided by ITS.  Known data from different countries reveal that in many applications made have been obtained reductions in journey times of around 20%, increases in network capacity of 10% and, in terms of safety, improvements of 15%. (1). These positive results prove the benefits that ITS systems can provide in a sustainable way to environment, efficiency, security of citizens and competitiveness. They confirm that now they constitute an indispensable tool in the implementation of mobility policies. However, it is necessary to implement a National ITS Architecture, based on the needs of users, providing a guide that orientates the design of compatible and interoperable solutions and components across the country and in the Mercosur region.  We must create a ¡°political-strategical¡± plan, with short and medium term priorities, which establishes the goals of the ITS and the actions needed to achieve them.  This plan should take into account different scenarios and challenges of growing demand of transportation that require deep structural changes in response to changes in the social model, in national competitiveness and in the Region goals, developing the technological and regulatory conditions to facilitate the full development of ITS. The plan must promote the full development of STI but with a marked "user orientation", "Society orientation" optical. This document is the result of a process of debate and comparisons, that should involve all key actors: institutions, universities, interested in the field of ITS, and will aim to present a series of thematic priorities for ITS, identified on the basis of national transport policy, and a set of possible measures and instruments to implement.  The report must represent a real contribution to the definition of a national policy that allows our country to respond effectively to the challenges of interoperability and to reap the benefits that ITS offer to the National Transportation System and to Logistics in general, in benefit of Economy, competitiveness and quality of life. This document should be enacted by law (why not an ITS Act?) (6) so that later, the Executive can regulate its use. It should state clearly that both, public officials and designers of infrastructure and transport vehicles, should be aware that road       Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -12-  safety, environmental protection and improved mobility are not options but obligations for everyone, so that it will not be admissible to install an ITS system to meet the objectives sought and mentioned, without taking into account the lessons learned, that are: no one could install a new bridge without a height detection sensor in the cross-track or new tunnels without fire safety systems, escape routes, signage and new incident detection, or traffic lights without pedestrian crossings and with adaptation to new highways, or routes without  variable information-to-the-user message signs and without a laying of optical fiber in all its extension.   The ITS: an important tool to support mobility policies (7) Transportation is a fundamental area to achieve the economic and social development of a Nation. It is hard to imagine a strong economic growth, jobs and wealth creation, without an efficient transport system that can work and operate fully seizing the advantages and opportunities of the internal trade market. There is, in all economically advanced Nations and, also in Argentina, a considerable increase in the demand of mobility of people and goods.  The increase in traffic volumes has led to an exacerbation of traffic congestion resulting in negative impacts on the environment, safety and quality of life. The social cost paid in terms of lost time, pollution and safety are huge, and the risk, very likely and of high impact, is that the increasing transport demand will make the costs impossible to sustain. The challenge faced by all industrialized countries is to ensure that all citizens and goods can travel safely, efficiently and in a compatible way with the environment, using all available means of transport. Experience shows that, to meet these objectives, not only new infrastructure should be done, but we must act on traffic flows, balancing the use of different means of transport (including maritime, rail and air).  Methods and IT technologies applied to Transportation have enabled the development of systems that solve "smartly" all the problems of mobility and transport. The introduction of ITS with a systemic view involves solving troubles of mobility with a new modality.          Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -13-  A National ITS Architecture is needed (7)  The promotion of the development and implementation of a national ITS arquitecture requires the establishment of a strategic framework with a common architecture in which applications, systems and services are integrated and interoperable. The development of proprietary solutions makes the interoperability between systems difficult and leads to inefficiencies and high costs and, therefore, to limited benefits for final users.  The main objective of the ITS Architecture is to create a favorable environment for innovation and development of innovative technologies and services that contribute to improve the transportation system and, at the same time, the competitiveness of local industry. Architecture, taking into account the user's needs, determine the specifications that an ITS system must meet, identifies the involved sectors and the strategies to adopt for the process of collecting, processing and managing information, based on the different applications, which must be consistent, integrated and interoperable. The architecture is divided into three parts: . Logical architecture of the system, which is a block diagram of the logic flows needed to meet the users? requirements;  . Physical architecture of the system, ie, the physical components that make up the system, functional, physical and logical  relationships  between the systems themselves and the flow of information;  . Organizational architecture of the system, ie, the stakeholders (organizations / institutions / companies) should be involved to ensure the development and full operation of ITS. The ITS Architecture provides, therefore, an ideal representation of how a system should be done to fully achieve the requirements of users and is, therefore, a reference guide for the design and implementation of ITS in the national area.  Thus, the various systems can "talk with each other", allowing to consider the entire transportation network as a single system where different ITS subsystems are interoperable. In this "systemic view", proprietary systems must be adapted to this architecture as they will not be able to operate as a closed system, but in synergy with other similar systems, in benefit of a higher efficiency.        Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -14-    Conclusions ITS systems are a key element in the implementation of sustainable mobility policies to achieve a fully integrated transport system, in which people and goods can move more efficiently, safely and protecting the environment.  Therefore, a general strategy on ITS must be defined, setting goals and priorities of short and medium term, measures to achieve them and to plan short and medium term investments, establish the expected benefits, evaluate them and adjust them towards continuous improvement. To do this, you must create the necessary technological, regulatory and organizational policies to accelerate integration and interoperability of ITS and to stimulate the development of a competitive market of ITS.  Thus, we can take full advantage of ITS systems, improving the national transportation system and, therefore, the quality of life, safety and competitiveness.  The proposal of this work is, then, "TO CREATE A NATIONAL (AND WHY NOT REGIONAL?) PROGRAM OF ITS" to improve the quality of life of the citizens. (7)  It was mentioned that the main objectives of ITS are: increasing road safety, reducing environmental pollution, improving mobility, cost reduction, rationalization of energy and travelling times reduction.  Those are not independent objectives, but complementary and convergent, and they correspond to different areas of the same strategy:  "Improving quality of life, happiness and welfare of people"          Daniel Gerardo Russomanno, Eng., MBA  -15-  These three concepts are similar but not the same, as they are measured and explained by different parameters (8). In our country, we could say that the fundamental national goals (9) are: national unity, economic growth with re-industrialization, social inclusion based on employment and improved income distribution. Nor are these separate objectives but complementary and convergent, corresponding to different areas of the same strategy: Improving quality of life, happiness and welfare of people. Therefore, when in terms of ITS, the systems are requested to be interoperable at the expense of proprietary systems, what is sought is a cost reduction, more and better suppliers that lead to market growth, actions against monopolistic practices and the possibility of local industrialization of these systems and products, with qualitative technical improvements that bring economic growth. When in terms of STIs we also talk about building integrated control centers interconnected between regions, cities, provinces, and between users and infrastructure, we talk about uniting the nation technologically, to acquire more knowledge, to create added value as a result of that knowledge, to have graduates of technical schools with high performance (which also causes increased employment), higher incomes and social inclusion as a result of the growth of this new STI category.  When it comes to improving public transport with ITS technology, with information for the user, with improved journey times, etc., with access to knowledge through variable message signs or information kiosks at bus stops, multimodal stations, electronic ticket payment subsidizing the demand, the one that has the least, it also means lower costs, more and better jobs  and better income distribution and social inclusion. Therefore there is a clear correlation between the goals of ITS and the State as such are contained within political and social national objectives. In recent years, the continuity of significant change in measures of technological improvements such as the program ¡°Argentina connected¡±, the program ¡°Connect Equality¡±, the recovery of technical schools, the growth of investment in public works, the creation of universities and the Ministry of Science and Technology, the defense and promotion of national industry, the creation of an ITS department into the National  Roads Administration and other measures in this direction invite to propose, taking the Optic Fiber of the program ¡°Argentina Connected¡± as one of the first basis of the physical architecture of the ITS technology, the creation of a National ITS Program. "In short, the economic growth produced an increased demand for transport, which implies greater need for STI technology and higher knowledge that will generate greater quality of life, greater prosperity and greater happiness for the people, which is, ultimately, the important thing".

Box  5015,  2600  GA  Delft,  The  Netherlands. j.l.m.vrancken@tudelft.nlKeyword: Standards Approaches and Policy INTRODUCTIONThis  paper  outlines  the  approach  to controlling  large  networks  in  Traffic Management (TM) Systems also called Active Traffic Management (ATM) for road traffic. In Traffic Management there is an important distinction  between  local-  and  network- control systems. The local systems, such as traffic light control in charge of one crossing, or a ramp metering device in charge of one on ramp, are most common. These systems are acting only on local problems. They cannot deal with the effects on the scale of their network or anticipate future traffic conditions. And even worse they may solve a congestion problem  within  their  own  scope  while creating a problem in an other section of the network as demonstrated in the following figure. TM  systems  are  essentially  systems  to coordinate  local  control  systems  within  a network. Although a number of these TM systems are commercially available, they are not  widely  used   by  traffic  management authorities.  This is mainly  caused  by  the incompatibility  of  Traffic  Management systems.  Compatibility  and  standardization issues play an important role in Network Management systems. These systems cover only a part of a network. Information about neighboring parts of the network is highly relevant.  A system  needs  to  receive  this information  from  neighboring  control systems. Therefore it has to communicate and to be compatible with other systems. Even within its own scope, it has to communicate with  the  local  systems  that  were  present before the installation of the Network Control systems as a subset of Network Management and deal with influencing streams of traffic. So also for local systems interfacing and compatibility issues are relevant.The first applications were purely functional. In addition, there was hardly any possibility to expand  or  adjust  them.  The  used implementation method was also very similar to  the  laboratory  situation  of  the  traffic engineer. As a result, in practice these systems were only suitable for single time use in the limited environment of a pilot.  In the next phase (concept development), the need for standardisation arose, driven by the desire to deploy systems on a larger scale. In our view, this is where the TM systems are now.Legacy systemsAnother important cause of this lack of ICT support is of a more technical nature. Many of the  systems  deployed  are  actually management systems for roadside systems. They  were  originally  developed  for  an entirely different purpose. Externally, such systems often do not contain an interface for computerised control, and internally they are not equipped to execute Traffic Management instructions. In addition, most systems were developed for managing only one type of roadside system (sometimes  even  from  only  one manufacturer). Considering that the issue at hand  in  the  case  of  Sustainable  Traffic Management  is  the  desired  cooperation between systems of different road managers, this  at  least  doubles  the  problems  of computerised input. As an example, the figure below gives an overview of all related systems of a practical test in Amsterdam.It clearly shows that a broad deployment of traffic systems in such a situation is a huge and time-consuming procedure. Therefore, the time has come for a more structured approach that  allows  for  an  easy  and  efficient deployment of the different components. SOLUTIONBy making a stronger connection between the structural, long-term ICT development for TM and  the  desired  Traffic  Management  end situation,  the  opportunity  arises  for accelerated growth of TM as a sector.  CT can then  translate  this  to  a  standardised  and transparent system environment.The alternative for the above heterogeneous system environment and the much needed sector-wide standardisation  is,  therefore,  a uniform,  standardised  system  environment. The question is, however, how this should be developed.The service modelFrom our experience, the way to arrive at this uniform system environment lies in finding a structured cooperation between the different systems, particularly on the level of traffic engineering. The basic principle here is that systems are classified according to the traffic engineering services they  offer.  This is a method used in the Netherlands for describing a specific effects on traffic, such as  reduce inflow.For each of these services, a standard interface is established. The interface will contain a description  of  the  desired  level  of  the reduction and the priority of the measure. In addition, the protocol should ideally be based on a modern interface protocol, such as DATEX2. This also is required for the traffic engineering (measuring) information that the system can provide. Designed in this way, this solution gives rise to a structured landscape of systems which achieves the required network functionality coordination.  The  Sustainable  Traffic Management (STM) handbook [3] will serve as the starting point for all needed services. This handbook describes a large number of services  that can  be  deployed  and  is  an accepted  tool  for  Sustainable  Traffic Management projects. THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SERVICE MODELThere are several stakeholders in the context of Network Management (NM) systems. In the next sections, both the general advantages (which apply for all) as well as the specific advantages  for  clients  and  suppliers  are described.General advantagesThe various Sustainable Traffic Management areas  can  easily  be  connected,  because everyone speaks the same language. As a result the effectiveness of NM will increase.¨C New measures can be added quickly and with ease, based on the traffic engineering effect they strive to achieve.¨C Interface specifications are clear and can therefore be provided as a part of the tender of a roadside or management system (no more discussions between two suppliers).¨C Network  management  environments can migrate and evolve faster, considering that the legacy is shielded/screened off by the service interface and they can remain part of the whole (or can easily be replaced).¨C The existing specialisation of effects can be maintained and can be utilised even better than before. Points to consider for this approach. The prioritising of different requesters of a service, for  example,  is  important.  The  MARCO research [1] can serve as a guideline. In this research, which was ordered by the Dutch road authority 'Rijkswaterstaat', the possibility of sharing actuators was investigated. The advised approach was chosen based on the final  management  goal  of  the  requestor. Examples  of  these  goals  are  Safety-Management and Capacity-Management, in which the first obviously has a higher priority than  the  last.  Even  the  actual  regulation strategy  (which  requestor  represents  the priority  route?)  can  be  taken  into consideration.Another point of consideration is managing the service library. Who will manage this, and who  is  responsible  for  the  specification? However,  similar  to  the  DATEX-2 specification of the measuring data from the NDW, we expect that this problem can be solved.SUGGESTED APPROACHConsidering the huge installed base of legacy systems, we suggest the following pragmatic approach: ¨C Determine  the  most  important  network management services in the short-term. Then, define  for  each  an  interface  specification based on DATEX-2. This data standard is open  and  leaves  sufficient  room  for  any change;¨C These standardisations are recorded and prescribed  when  new  measuring  and/or network management systems are supplied;¨C Classify the existing systems based on the defined services, and add these if desired (and if possible). An important advantage of this approach is the simplicity in the migration path. No ¡®big bang¡¯ with radical changes occurs. A gradual implementation that can start immediately is adopted instead. As a result, definitions will not be outdated by the time the execution can finally be started. Also, existing systems as well as any extra services can be added at any desired moment.CONCLUSIONAt  this  moment  there  are  insufficient synergies  between  the  desired,  transport engineering,  TM functionality and the ICT systems used. By intelligently designing the system  environment  and  architecture  in accordance with the proposed service model, fast and controlled steps forward can be made, without the enormous risks involved in a new total  solution.  In  addition,  the  proposed solution  stimulates  both  competition  and innovation, and it also gives an important blueprint  for  a  potentially  international standard.

The most basic default type of scheduling readout is a whole-number stepping RSU emplaced readout as well as a whole number stepping mobile readout. This paper clarifies the error possibilities of  ¡°overlapping/cross-assigning¡± in that type of HMI readout. It will explain what the errors look like at various locations throughout the service cycle Pi (i.e. R+G+Y, and/or FLOW sequences), as well as error occurrence in individual Vsa  (speed assignment) cycles. Also, it will explain ways to mitigate the errors where they may be too large. This mitigation will briefly touch on other types of emplacing, as well as different hardware and different types of graphics.

B A C K G R O U N D  FLOW means Fast Lane On Warning. This paradigm allows for vehicles to remain in the high energy state and thus significantly reduce fuel consumption rates. Other byproducts of remaining in the high energy state include reduced emissions and most often, more mobility. One use of the FLOW paradigm is to schedule vehicles through traffic signals while in the green phase. What is Green Phase Scheduling? The main component of green-phase schedulers are sequencers, which take cues from the traffic signal. Schedulers must also involve Human Machine Interfaces (HMI), which are affiliated at the output end, and perceived by motorists.  In their simplest form, the sequencers consist of RGY cycle coupled with FLOW readout cycle. A more advanced form of sequencer includes sensory adaptive, which can alter the phases and sub phases based on high resolution sensory-vision network. The two main HMI classes include emplacements or roadside units /equipment RSU (RSE), as well as on-board mobile readouts; OBU.  While there is great variety in HMI types, the simplest default would be a whole number stair step output. Whole Numbers represent the tightest reasonable differentiation perception by motorists verses a reasonable consolidation pattern that minimizes cross-assignments (where vehicles speed assignments overtake one another). This occurs most naturally in a RSU, occurring especially at a ¡°node¡± or threshold on the approach to the signal. Threshold and node are interchangeable because, borrowing from wave physics, it is a place where the amplitude could be said to be highest.  ¡°Node¡± applies here because it is at the inflection place closest to the intersection where the sum of  all the readouts can run completely through a cycle and match the R+G+Y cycle Pi; it is where the two cycles are in phase. Anywhere closer to the signal from the node will produce blind spots; anywhere further from the node will produce ambiguity. The scope of this paper pertains to ¡°constant velocity¡± speed assignments/readouts as a governing function and  base function while involving adaptivity. The region between the node and the signal is the ¡°trap¡± and this is the range where relative compression takes place. In stair step fashion, and at the node location, the constant velocity readouts ¡°touch one another¡± from the beginning of one readout cycle to the end of the next readout cycle. If one were to reference a distance/position closer to the signal respect to the node, then there would be a ¡°void¡± or empty space: a part of the service cycle, Pi  where no speed assignment could schedule ?©\?3?©\??a vehicle through the green phase without exceeding the speed limit or messing with alternate Pi service cycles . Assuming an even distribution of constant velocity readouts that schedule a vehicle through the green phase, a void would be where green-phase speed assignments or Vsa could not occur. Near the node/threshold, the void time period is small with respect to the cycle. The closer one positions oneself towards the intersection, the bigger the void gets until there is a void time period that happens at the intersection that represents the red phase, the yellow phase and if using safety time buffers, some of the green phase. The remainder of the cycle is the Tng or ¡°net¡± green segment during which time, the scheduled FLOW traffic passes through.  FIGURE 1  The top bar represents random traffic approaching the run-up before it encounters the trap (i.e before it crosses the node or threshold). It is moving towards the left and is of length L =  Pi*(speed limit). It is of the same pass-through time, Pi, and length as the lower pattern. The lower pattern shows the FLOW pattern just before the Tng part goes through the intersection.  Random vehicles in the above pattern are instructed which speed to go in order to get through the light while green. The lower pattern includes red , green, yellow, i.e. L =  (R+G+Y)*(Speed Limit),  with the green length further being  divided up into pgS, Tng and Psf. pgS and Psf are safety time buffers within the green phase.  By the time traffic reaches the intersection it is ¡°consolidated¡± or ¡°compressed¡± to within the Tng ?©\?4?©\??Movement in the FLOW platoon or pattern is represented by the following equation: ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ§£ (Reference 1) Which grew out of X=V/t. The above equation explains the general idea and reads like ¡°the change in velocity with respect to time is equal to the change in position with respect to time per the change in time with respect to position¡±.   The only meaningful thing about this equation is that each expression derived form X, V, t  denotes the changing in each of those variables. There are three basic rules for scheduling traffic through the green phase of a signal. They are: 1. That minimal or no cross-assigning takes place during the trap consolidation, i.e. that minimal or no passing/ overtaking takes place in the trap, 2. That the speed limit is not exceeded, 3. That the same general proportions encountered during the earlier approach be carried through, or improved upon to the FLOW pattern during consolidation. Note that optimal headway spacing can take place if sensory based ¡°tailgate relief¡± is applied.  Applying these parameters provides for a  solution to that equation: ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ§§¡þ¡þ¡þ1 ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ§§ (Reference 2) Where Vsa is an output of ¡°speed assignment¡±.   X =  Position in the run-up or distance from the place where the datum is taken to the intersection.  Pi = Service cycle of the intersection.  Pa =  Time accumulated or difference between the arrival instant at the trap and the time from the previous ending pattern, such that 0<Pa< Pi.  pgS = Safe green period at the beginning of the platoon or FLOW pattern that allows for previously waiting traffic to be able to get started and clear out before the new one arrives, as ?©\?5?©\??well as being a safety buffer for motorists at the lead of the pattern who arrive earlier than their readouts indicate.  Tng =  The net green time period where a predetermined safe number of vehicles, the FLOW pattern,  passes through.  Psf = AFTER Tng time buffer for safe following. This buffer absorbs stragglers (motorists arriving later than their readouts indicate), and a limited number of vehicles who turn onto the trap during the passing of the present pattern.  Tng could be further reduced to allow this period so that G = pgS + Tng + Psf  . Note that Psf does not show up in the equation but can be addressed by reducing the duration of Tng and/or pgS by the appropriate amount. Tng can also be applied to left turn greens, coordinated walk periods, bike approaches, 5-way intersections, etc.  as long as the approach pattern is lean enough (given the safety formula), and the resolution is clear enough ?FIGURE 2  Small cycles of speed assignments touch each other ¡°beginning to end¡±  in the vicinity of the threshold on the left.  At the threshold, the time lengths of all of the small  Vsa  segments make up the service cycle of the signal Pi. For small time intervals each speed assignment cycles through and remains at a constant readout. By the location of the intersection, and by full consolidation, the constant velocity assignments will have to overlap.  ?©\?6?©\??WHOLE    NUMBER   INCREMENTING   OUTPUTS One of the most basic output types is where speed assignments come in whole number increments in an RSU output. As a motorists approach the threshold, they can be given a speed assignment such that when they pass the actual point they resume that constant speed till they reach the vicinity of the intersection. The aggregate summated output is a set of FLOW outputs that run through a repeating sequence (like the RGY) that is coupled with the signal cycle. There is a distinct error based on kinematic result of following the whole number stair step readout. The challenge is that to have any chance of readouts being perceivable, they must increment in whole  numbers or greater (like multiples of 5). The jump caused by incrementing in whole numbers causes the error. It should be noted that if the ideal output represents a centerline that balances a distribution between late and early acted upon readouts.   The first step in guiding the outputs would be threefold:  1.  To place the centerline at the beginning or end of the distribution. 2.  To place the centerline in the center of the distribution. 3.  To add other functions or vary the placement of the ideal path as a centerline.   I D E N T I F Y I N G   S I N G L E    S T E P    H M I    E R R O R         Specifically, error can be accrued as a result of single step whole number speed assignments. By the very nature of consolidation/compression and by having to spread the HMI speed assignment Vsa outputs into perceivable increments, i.e. whole numbers, the coarse resolution of the whole number vs. the need for fine-tuning in compression creates challenges. So where do the error occurrences take place?  Constant velocity readouts flatten out for the duration of the perception. If the duration or cycle period of a speed assignment is, say, 5 seconds, that assignment for that duration will send a vehicle to the intersection for the same straight period of time. Errors in constant speed assignments occur largest at the transition point of the step, or where the assignment ¡°jumps¡±. A sudden jump of the whole number ¡°stair step¡± causes the faster assignment to minutely cross-assign or causes the later occurring faster assignment to want to ?©\?7?©\??pass/overtake the slower speed assignment ahead. The later faster assignment ¡°drifts¡± past the earlier one as long as the transition occurs when one vehicle is exiting and another is entering the threshold. While this would push the boundaries physically and legally single lane, it can occur in multi lanes in a side by side/ catty-corner scenario. ??FIGURE 3  Distance of error in feet (vertical axis) as a function of readout  speed assignment (horizontal axis) from Vsa = 20 through 45. At the exact  transition the followers¡¯ higher value speed assignment Vsa will ideally want to overtake the slower earlier one by a short length(with respect to the trap size. At a certain point, the process transpires from a digital pattern to an analog almost optical focus that is filtered by algorithms and functions. In FIGURE   2, the speed assignments are touching each other lead-to-end. By the time the reference point (moving in the pattern) reaches the signal, they overlap. FIGURE  5 shows an example of a ¡°floor¡± where there is no overlap and the possibility of increasing overlap from ahead or behind. In FIGURE 6, there is a locus of these charts that add up to Pi.  FIGURE 3 shows the varying nature of the overlap expressed as a distance in feet, and implying that the loci, one for every Vsa, start large with low Vsa and get smaller with higher later Vsa as also expressed in FIGURE 6. 05010015020025020 25 30 35 40 45Overlap?Error?(feet)Speed?Assignment?Vsa??©\?8?©\??

FIGURE6   Note the differences between Vsa Charts as Pi matures, and the relationship of the charts from slower to faster Vsa readouts. Also note that since faster readout cycles are shorter in duration, that the X-axis proportions get smaller. While the Y-axis shows distance of overlap, it could also represent time.           ?©\?11?©\??E R R O R    M I T I G A T I ON  A B S O R B I N G     E R R O R      I N     G E N E R A L  The safety time buffers Psf and pgS (FIGURE   1) represent the first line of defense against error that is caused by ¡°drift¡±. If speed assignments are too fast or too slow, or more realistically, if the motorist does not follow assignments closely enough, it may still be possible for the motorist to navigate through the green as well as co-navigate the trap with other vehicles that are reasonably spaced, and may also approach with error.  NINE    MORE  SPECIFIC   WAYS   THAT   ERROR   CAN    BE    MITIGATED 1.  NATURAL HEADWAYS:  At the threshold, the speed assignments touch each other. That works in theory, but vehicles do not touch each other except in multi lane while represented in one dimension. Natural headways will automatically mitigate some of the potential for overlapping assignments. A one second headway at 45 MPH is 65 feet, 2 second near 130; 3 second just under 200. Depending on who you listen to, a safe following distance can almost clear the total overlap.  2. BIG  SPACE:  As long as safety cutoffs are functioning, there should be lots of space in pre-consolidation. There will also be large likelihood that vehicles will not be near each other in a random approach. The likelihood of a platoon of tailgaters is fairly remote. Example, 7 vehicles is a ¡°full house¡± in the specs shown in APPENDIX  2, and will have an average headway of .13 miles. If those vehicles have 2 sec headways the total sum of headway distance  is .17 miles for a total headway to trap distance ratio of under 20%. In other words, all the headways put together is lass than 20 % of the trap distance. Exception: when lead vehicle is slow and is followed by pile-up all in a single lane. 3. FORCE THE SPACE (Part One): Scheduling equipment should have a safety shutoff/ counter (as mentioned above). If the net headway at the signal is exceeded as ascertained by a count at the threshold, the scheduling should be suspended. There is also a chance that it could be left on and ignored (See #  3). There could only  7 (maybe 5) places or slots in a pattern for the specs given (See APPENDIX 2) , and beyond that the pattern would be over saturated at signal. Another way to put it would be that the scheduling systems would/should be in shut off mode if the traffic was so dense as to begin commonly functioning in a scenario that would lend itself to overlapping assignments. 4. COULD WE COUNT ON EXISTING NATURE? Aside form occasional disappointments, drivers already possess good habits. If the headway shrinks, they instinctively slow down. Could ?©\?12?©\??these instincts override the desire for mobility? If the assignment told a motorist to drive faster than the platoon ahead, would that motorist instinctively disregard the assignment? Would they experience a minor disappointment (like missing a green phase due to a group of slower moving vehicles ahead instead of causing a misshap? Driver Clinics including ¡°Na?ve Drivers¡± can help find the answers to this question. 5. SPACE BY INFRASTRUCTURE: Use multiple lanes to increase the ratio headway to vehicles. Or appoint scheduling hardware with small enough traffic to road space ratio, and function scheduling hardware to leaner traffic times of day.  6. FORCE THE SPACE (Part 2) SPACE    BY   INTELLIGENCE: The use of ¡°spreading out algorithms¡± can  create  space within a trap and within a pattern on an individual basis. They can evenly distribute the pattern and discourage tailgating. Also, these can increase mobility. The downside is that they would need a high resolution sensory vision network which could be a sizeable capitol investment. 7. HIGHER  RESOLUTION WITH GRAPHICS:  Use differentiation in an HMI  or RSE to make the error smaller and smaller till it disappears. Graphics and OBUs can especially facilitate higher differentiation and higher resolution. Additionally, sound can even work in concert with OBU¡¯s. 8. HIGHER RESOLUTION WITH ¡°ANIMATION¡±:   Graphics could use animation including examples of HMI like a ¡°LED¡± type, or a RSE like ¡°speed strips¡±. 9. MULTIPLE APPROACHES:  Use  differing media to work together or use media types that  that complement each other, i.e. RSU OBU. With the many possibilities of Human Machine Interfaces that could be applied to Green Phase Scheduling, one of the most basic defaults is the stair step digital readout. Using this method creates distinct and easily traceable pattern of errors. Right out of the gate, some of the range of these errors can be overcome by simply driving nice while involved with. A three second headway would almost cancel out the whole error at a 45 MPH approach. Automatic error reducers include a net headway minimum count hooked up at the approach that suspends scheduling activity if traffic is too dense. Another cure for error would include sensor based run ups: For the good news, they would be very reliable, have hugely high resolution. For the bad news, they would be expensive with lots of components. Perhaps the gain in mobility and reduction in fuel consumption rate could help justify them Other ways to reduce error would include the use of graphics, animation, and multi-approaches to work together or provide back up and redundancy.    ?©\?13?©\??CONTINUING RESEARCH  COGNATIVE    PSYCOLOGY   WITH   A   TOUCH OF ERGONOMICS  The next step to perform in analyzing error would be to conduct reaction and ergonomic tests with diverse range of subjects to see if driving habits would override the error. It is the author¡¯s opinion that there would be a ¡°flight¡± or ¡°flock¡±  mentality that might take precedence. Further testing might drive for diversity including limitations and try and deliberately met out cross-assigning behavior. Connected Vehicle Research at the time of this writing includes ¡°Driver Clinics¡± using ¡°Niave Drivers¡±. A step further from Niave would be to try to deliberately recruit drivers who would explore the boundries and limitations, as well as introducing limitations.. Obviously, continuing research would also include further examination of diverse HMI methodologies and combinations of same. For example, an RSU combined with an OBU, or combining multiple RSU types in the same environments either to complement each other or to provide for a back up/ safeguard.  The sensory vision would be a high-capitol investment but would also be the ultimate solution in distributing traffic on an individual basis that a high resolution. Meanwhile, there would be a class of motorists who could immediately possess or quickly learn the skills and desire the benefit from FLOW including bus drivers and truck drivers. ????????©\?14?©\??APENDICES??APENDIX?ONE?Standards?for?¡°vision¡±?used?in?sensory?based?adaptive?sequencers/?Degrees?of?resolution?DISTANCE?+/©\?1?meter?(3?ft)?TIME??.06?sec;??high?end:???.020?sec????APENDIX?TWO?

-1- VEHICLE LOCALIZATION IN URBAN AREAS USING AERIAL IMAGES  Norman Mattern and Gerd Wanielik Professorship of Communications Engineering, Chemnitz University of Technology Reichenhainer Str. 70, 09126 Chemnitz, Germany Phone: +49 371 531 36749, Fax: +49 371 531 836749 norman.mattern@etit.tu-chemnitz.de  ABSTRACT Accurate, reliable, and cost-efficient positioning systems are in the focus of research for Intelligent Transportation Systems. Especially low-cost GNSS-based systems do in general not achieve sufficient performance. However, augmenting them with other sensors can compensate the shortcomings of those systems. The scope of this paper is vehicular positioning in urban environments using a low-cost GPS, vehicle odometry sensors, a gray scale camera and a digital map. That is, a novel camera-augmented positioning approach using accurate and high-resolution aerial image without the necessity of any human preprocessing is presented. The system uses an innovative particle filter which does not work on feature level detecting and extracting geometric shapes; it rather predicts complete camera images using a structure tensor representation generated from aerial images. In contrast to classical landmark-based approaches, there is no more a need for a manual or even semi-automatic feature extraction step. Eventually the performance of the system is compared to algorithms which use manually preprocessed maps. For this evaluation real sensor data and high-accurate ground truth data from a GPS/INS system were used. INTRODUCTION Intelligent Transportation Systems are a major driver of innovation. Particularly, intelligent vehicles utilizing Car-to-X communication and digital maps have already been demonstrated by different European Research projects. One of the prerequisites of a communication and map based Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is accurate and reliable positioning. Although the demands could be matched with existing high-performance sensors, a stand-alone low-cost system with the necessary performance is not yet available. Landmark-based positioning algorithms are a possible way to solve this positioning problem. They combine cost efficient in-vehicle sensors like odometers, inertial sensors, or GPS receivers of navigation devices with other sensors, which are also available if the vehicle is equipped with other ADASs like an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which usually comprises a radar or laser scanner and/or a camera anyway. However, a highly accurate and detailed map is still a requirement which cannot be met with current standard navigation maps. -2- LOCALIZATION USING IMAGE PREDICTION The classic steps of an image-landmark based positioning approach are shown in the upper row of Figure 1. Starting with the raw camera image data, features like points or lines are extracted from the image. Landmarks stored in a digital feature map are assigned to the extracted features and the estimate of the system¡¯s current position is updated based on the measured features, usually using a Bayes filter like the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF, see (1)). This approach contains at least two error prone algorithmic steps, the feature extraction and the assignment.  Figure 1: Processing steps of image landmark based positioning In (2) it was shown how¨Cusing a particle filter (1)¨Cthese steps can be omitted by performing the position update not based on extracted and assigned features, but on complete predicted images (Figure 1, second lowest row). To do so, a so-called class image was predicted based on a given position hypothesis and a feature level map. Figure 2 illustrates this: The left image shows the camera image (with re-projected map features based on the current estimate) and the center image shows the class image predicted by the system (white indicates lane marker, gray indicates road surface). The corresponding feature map is shown in Figure 3, left side.    Figure 2: Gray scale image, predicted class image and coherency image (left to right) (2) The position update itself is performed by not directly evaluating the likelihood between the Cam. imageFeature extractionAssignmentPosition updateCam. imageFeature extractionPosition updateCam. imagePosition updateAerial imageAerial imageAerial imageFeat. mapFeat. mapCam. imagePosition updateAerial imageFeat. map-3- gray scale and the class image, but the likelihood between the class image and a coherency image calculated from the structure tensors, which turned out to be better suited for this purpose. Although the system performed excellent, a drawback and barrier for mass market use remains. Currently, the detailed maps including lane markings, arrows and so on used by this system cannot be generated fully automatic, hence, the maps have to be either generated by humans or the results of an automatic conversion have to be checked and adopted.  LOCALIZATION USING AERIAL IMAGES The system presented in this paper shows how even the map generation step can be omitted by directly using aerial images for positioning. To do so, the aerial image is converted to structure tensor and coherency image representation, respectively. The center of Figure 3 shows the raw aerial image and the right-hand figure the result of the conversion step in false colors, where the color itself indicates the primary gradient direction. The hue codes the ¡®strength¡¯ of the gradient.    Figure 3: Feature map (left), raw aerial image (center) and preprocessed aerial image (right) of an intersection Based on this image, the coherency image like on the right side of Figure 2 can directly be predicted and used for the evaluation and position update step, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates those intermediate results, which correspond with the components of an update step of a Bayer filter. Figure 4 (a) shows the raw image acquired by the gray scale camera of the vehicle; (b) shows the same measurement but after the conversion into structure tensor representation. This is the measurement used for the Bayes filter update. Figure 4 (c) shows the measurement prediction given a certain position hypothesis (based on the map in (d) and the field-of-view shown by the magenta box). Following the Bayes filter principle, a number of position hypotheses (¡°particles¡±) is selected, the measurement is predicted like shown in Figure 4 (c) and compared to the actual measurement (b). The more similar both components are, the more likely is that the vehicle is at that position. The particles of the Filter are also shown in Figure 4 (d). -4-  (a) Camera image  (b) Structure tensor representation of the Camera Image (measurement)  (c) Structure tensor values generated using the map, which represents the measurement prediction.

All test data was provided by the concept vehicle CARAI (3) of the Professorship of Communications Engineering. A 640x480 pixel gray scale camera with 30 fps was used as video sensors. An unprocessed aerial image provides map information. Furthermore, an u-Blox Antaris 4 was used low-cost single frequency GPS receiver. Finally, we accessed the CAN bus of the test vehicles and used velocity and yaw rate information. Besides the components for localization, a NovAtel SPAN system was connected as Ground Truth sensor for the evaluation.      CameraDigital MapVehicle odometry?Blox GPSNovAtel SPANLocalization@CaraiEvaluation      Figure 6: Test vehicle CARAI with various sensors -6- RESULTS METHODOLOGY For the evaluation of the presented algorithm we used a geo-referenced aerial image with 10 cm ground resolution. The area where the test drive was performed is depicted in Figure 7. Our test vehicle Carai was equipped with a NovAtel SPAN GPS/INS system (ProPak V3-RT2i with HG1700-58 IMU), which provides an accuracy of a few cm also during satellite outages. It was used as ground truth with 50 Hz update rate for the position measurements. Each time a ground truth measurement was available, the system¡¯s position estimate was calculated at this time. Subsequently, different characteristic values were calculated. First of all, we determined the absolute position error (referred to as position error) by differencing position ground truth and the position estimate of our system. As a position has no direction, the absolute position error has no direction component as well, but is just a scalar value. Furthermore, the lateral position error is of interest in lane specific warning applications, whereas the longitudinal position error is of interest for example for red light violation application. Eventually, histograms for all three types of position errors were created.   Figure 7: Aerial view of the test drive area. Feature landmarks of the digital map are drawn blue; the vehicle trajectory provided by the ground truth is shown red. -7- The test drive in the city center of Chemnitz had duration of 30 minutes. The recorded ground truth trajectory is shown in red in Figure 7. A couple of loops were gone, trying to use each available lane at least one time and alternating the rotation direction, i.e., clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, after almost each loop.  QUANTITATIVE RESULTS Figure 8 shows the result of the histogram calculation of the presented approach. It depicts the relative as well as the cumulated frequencies of the position errors. For the feature map approach can be stated that approx. 80 percent of the position estimates had a lateral or longitudinal error less that 1 m. Selected error intervals are listed in Table 1. The authors would like emphasize that there was no smart pre-processing of the aerial image. The relative frequencies in the histogram show some small local peaks at the error classes around 3.5 and 7 m, which equals the average lane width, i.e., in that cases the wrong lane was chosen by the algorithm.  Error Interval 1 m 1,5 m Absolute position 49 % 60 % Lateral position 60 % 66 % Longitudinal position 69 % 77 % Table 1: Position Error Intervals of the Aerial Image Approach When analyzing the problematic situations of the aerial image approach, it proved that vehicles in the aerial images, shadows, occlusion, and inhomogeneous lighting conditions seem to be the main error sources. Another unexpected effect was caused by the aerial images itself. As they were provided using a ¡¯lossy¡¯ compression format, the images contained compression artifacts. This caused a hard to model error in the calculation of the main orientation of the structure tensor.  -8-  Figure 8: Position Error Histogram of the Aerial Image Approach  CONCLUSION The aerial image works well general, the positioning inside a lane could be shown; however, the distinction of different lane yields still potential for improvement. Nonetheless, the used data was not preprocessed in any smart way; that is, neither in the camera image nor in the aerial image vehicles or shadows were detected and handled. Besides this addressing of pre-processing, other likelihood functions will be evaluated in future work.

The system works in connection with the speed limits on the road network. It is thus essential to keep the speed limit map used in the Intelligent Speed Adaptation scheme updated. The traditional method of updating speed limit maps on the basis of long time interval observations needed to be replaced by a more efficient speed limit updating tool. In a Danish Intelligent Speed Adaptation trial a web-based tool was therefore developed to give road authorities the opportunity to keep the speed limit map updated. However, the feedback from road authorities was insufficient. Hence a new web application based on Google Maps was made to provide easier speed limit updates for road authorities. The lessons learnt were that tools for map updating should preferably be made on the basis of a commercial map provider,  ? 2 ?such as Google Maps and that the real challenge is to oblige road authorities to carry out updates.   KEYWORDS  Intelligent Speed Adaptation, Intelligent Transport Systems, Road Safety, Digital maps, Speed limits   INTRODUCTION  Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) is an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) which is an efficient tool to help drivers maintain appropriate speed on the road network. Avoiding speeding results in a considerable improvement in road safety, and ISA is found to have a significantly positive effect on driving behaviour (1, 2, 3). Because feedback in ISA systems is normally based on the speed limit on the individual road, it is essential that the speed limit, which forms the basis for the feedback, is identical to the actual one. Therefore, ISA is highly dependent on an updated speed limit map (speed map) to provide usable feedback to the participating drivers. Hence reliable updating of the speed map is essential. E.g. the participating drivers in the Australian TAC Safecar ISA trial found that the most serious problem during the trial were errors due to an inaccurate speed map (4). Also, an ISA trial in Stockholm, Sweden, had massive delays as well, which were mainly caused by problems with the digital speed map (5). Furthermore, governmental reports from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have stressed that keeping a speed map updated is a challenge and that it is essential for a successful ISA trial (6, 7). In 2009 it was found that in the Flemish part of Belgium only 23% of the municipalities had speed limit data stored in a database, so a fully functional speed map will be available some years from now at the earliest (8, 9).   Most commercial map providers have developed their own systems to collect map updates. Originally, these maps were based on map data provided by road authorities and included various degrees of updates from the authorities. The updating procedures for a few map providers on the Danish market are:  Krak bases their maps on the Dansk Adresse- & Vejdatabase (Danish Address and Road database) (DAV) from which they receive an annual update. In addition, the municipalities and the Danish Road Directorate are contacted ad hoc. No standard procedures for these contacts are used and they are mostly based on information on new projects for verification. Also, map users send in a large number of corrections, which are then verified by the authorities. Krak does not rely on field workers to observe the changes (10). The Danish Yellow Pages receive their updates from The Danish National Survey and Cadastre, and supplement with user feedback (11).   One of the large international companies in this area is Navteq, which has developed digital maps in most countries. The company has several hundred field workers who continually update the digital maps. As for the Danish providers their updates are supplemented with user feedback (12).  Also TeleAtlas provides digital maps in Denmark. Their digital map for Denmark was initially based on a version of DAV from the early 1990s. The latter is supplemented with  ? 3 ?feedback from a number of employees in the field and with user feedback in order to keep the map updated. Information from municipalities and the Danish Road Directorate is added, as well. During the last few years, mobile mapping has been a central part of the updating procedure. Main roads are driven through/checked every year and less important roads every four years. TeleAtlas does not use new updates from DAV, so their map will gradually ?grow? away from those used by the Danish road authorities (13)  The above procedures are used by a number of map providers on the Danish market. Common to the creation of digital maps by providers in Denmark is that: 1: speed limit data were available only for main roads; 2: updating procedures were more or less sporadic and carried out at large time intervals ? especially on less used roads; and 3: no documentation on the quality of these updates was accessible. When decisions were made concerning a speed limit map for the ISA trial none of the providers were able to document that their speed limit information was up to date and updated on a regular basis. Unfortunately, none of them met the high requirements for an ISA trial.   METHODS  THE ISA TRIAL In Denmark the ISA trial Pay As You Speed (PAYS) (3) involving 153 drivers was carried out in the period from 2004 to 2009. Driving behaviour was connected with the size of a financial bonus on the participating drivers? car insurance rate. If drivers completely avoided speeding, a bonus equivalent to 30% of the insurance rate was paid out. The bonus was reduced stepwise depending on the length and the seriousness of the speed limit violations. However, it could never be negative.  1ST GENERATION SPEED LIMIT MAP UPDATES FOR THE DANISH ISA TRIALS In the light of the challenges mentioned above, the idea behind the PAYS trial was to develop a speed map in close cooperation with the Danish road authorities. The map would be based on an existing map with no speed limits but road authorities would contribute continuous updates. Both road authorities and the organisation behind PAYS had an interest in acquiring an updated speed map, PAYS for ISA purposes and the municipalities for having access to a fully updated speed map. By involving road authorities, i.e. municipalities, the speed map would (in theory) always be updated.   The digital speed limit map is based on the registration of all speed limit signs in the former County of North Jutland comprising about 22,000 km of roads including publicly and privately owned roads (14). Besides data from some of the local road authorities, the registration was carried out by student workers driving through the entire road network using a GPS unit and a customized keyboard for marking the signposts in the correct locations (Figure 1).   ? 4 ? Figure 1. The customized keyboard for registering speed signs.  In total, 5,600 speed limit signs were recorded and inserted into the digital road map. The use of resources was moderate: four student workers and two cars for a 4-week period. A digital speed sign database access was provided via a web-based tool for local road authorities, which enabled the road authorities workers to update the speed signs via a webpage and, even more relevant to them, they always had direct access to a map with updated speed limit signs.  From the speed sign database the speed limit map was developed by matching the speed signs to a digital road map. The process was accomplished by means of GEOCAD, a map-editing program, (http://www.geocad.dk/), though some extensions to GEOCAD were developed for this process to be done (semi-automatically). Figure 2 shows part of the digital road map with the map-matched speed signs and Figure 3 shows a section of the digital map with speed limit attributes.   Figure 2. The digital road map with map-matched speed limit signs.    ? 5 ? Figure 3. The digital road map with speed attributes.  The detailed digital speed limit map, including all roads, covers the former County of North Jutland only. The roads in the rest of Denmark have to some extent been incorporated in a speed limit map comprising all roads with a speed limit of 90 km/h or higher. In the remaining road network outside North Jutland equipment could react if a driver exceeds the general 80-km/h speed limit outside built-up areas. By these means participants in the PAYS field trial were prevented from speeding on most roads in Denmark, however, they could not be prevented from driving too fast in built-up areas and in other locations with a speed limit lower than 80 km/h outside North Jutland. The speed limit map did not include roads outside the borders of Denmark so the ISA equipment was temporarily deactivated there. (14)  To keep the speed map updated and receive data from the municipalities a web application was developed. Via this application the municipalities, of the former County of North Jutland, and the Danish Road Directorate had access to the tool to maintain the speed map. See figure 4.   Figure 4. A Screen dump of the web application using which road authorities could find information about speed limits and also make updates.  In theory, this solution would provide a more reliable speed map. Changes in speed limits would be reported and updated immediately, and errors would basically not appear. This approach is opposite to the traditional one according to which updates were made at certain (long) intervals. However, despite the easy updating procedures and the reasonable  ? 6 ?expectation that the authorities would be interested in the updated speed limit map, keeping the speed map updated turned out to be a challenge. In theory, there ought to be a fully updated digital speed sign database and an updated digital speed limit map at all times. In practice, however, the required maintenance of the speed sign database has proved to be a greater challenge than expected. All municipalities in North Jutland were positive about the idea of a database and agreed that it was important to keep it updated; but the actual maintenance has been highly insufficient (15, 16).  At that time (late 2006) the road authorities of North Jutland consisted of 27 municipalities and the County. The municipalities owned 7,800 km of public roads. Feedback was disappointing, and no updates were received from municipalities, which administered some 4,000 km of the public roads.  We conducted a study to elicit why the speed map maintenance tool was not used. Some road authorities had forgotten about the application, others lacked resources to maintain the speed map, and a few stated that they did not have sufficient IT skills. The reason given most often was that no changes had been made to the speed limits on their roads. As the PAYS staff observed in the field, however, the reality was that speed limit signs had been changed although the municipality responsible said the opposite. Furthermore, more than half of the municipalities kept no register of speed limits no speed limit changes would be registered anywhere. County roads and national roads were not included in our study of speed map updating procedures (15, 16).  2ND GENERATION SPEED LIMIT MAP UPDATING TOOL By early 2007, a reform of the Danish municipal structure was fully implemented. Municipalities became larger (from 27 to 8 municipalities in the area); hence the staff at their disposal was more specialised. This was expected to result in more reliable feedback concerning speed map updates.  Also, on the presumption that an improved user interface on the updating application would make it easier to get more adequate feedback from road authorities the PAYS staff developed a particular Google Maps-based application for this purpose. The sign system gave the users access to the standard Google Maps views: map, satellite, or hybrid. The existing road infrastructure map with speed limit signs is available as an overlay on the map or satellite imagery. The signs were displayed as pins when an appropriate zoom level was met. The information which was available to the public appears in figure 5.     ? 7 ?  Figure 5. Screen dump of the web application in a built-up area. Left: the speed sign-posts. Right: the speed signposts and the speed limit map of the same area.  Each pin is click enabled and displays sign information in a status window available to the right of the screen. The information shown is about the exact signpost type and for which driving direction it is meant. The latter is important because the same speed limit does not apply to either direction on a number of roads.  Road authorities were given access to a password-protected application enabling them to make changes to the map, i.e. insert or delete road signs. Moreover, new functionality to add or remove a particular road segment was added. Newly inserted road segments and signs were marked in yellow to indicate that the signs were waiting for approval. Thus road authorities would have access to the same opportunities, as originally intended in relation to the first generation updating tool. See figure 6.   Figure 6. The updating tool with drop-down menus to the right.  SIGN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The sign system user interface was implemented using PHP and JavaScript. The Google Maps application was used to draw the map canvas and to manage overlays in it. Sign locations and all user actions were recorded in a PostgreSQL database. The PAYS speed map was displayed as an overlay from an ArcGIS shape file using the free map server for Windows (MS4W) WMS service. See figure 7.   ? 8 ? Figure 7. PAYS speed map application architecture.   RESULTS AND FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS  The new, updated web application was presented to those in charge of roadmaps in the new municipalities in August 2008. The new map-update application constituted a significantly more intuitive and user-friendly tool.  A few municipalities used the new application in the next three months. 2 municipalities used the application and inserted 10 new speed limit signs and 3 new road segments. On the whole, the same pattern emerged as in 2006, when about 300 signs were inserted by 17 municipalities. Several municipalities still did not update the speed map, in fact the speed map became more and more outdated. Late in 2008 the PAYS trial ended and at that time also the maintenance of the speed map was terminated. However, the system is still available to the public at ? http://130.225.61.67:8080/skilte/, where it is possible to proceed as an unregistered user or to log in as a registered user (user: demo; password: demo1234).  It is a practicable challenge to develop a tool which can collect data about map updates in a sufficiently user-friendly way. The PAYS team found that any future updating applications should preferably be based on service made accessible by commercial map providers such as Google Maps. Such applications can be made cheaper and faster, and furthermore it is no easy task for homemade applications to compete with the level of user-friendliness and intuitive and clear interface offered by these commercial services.  The idea of developing a fully updated speed map on the basis of shared responsibility seemed convincing. However, even positive intentions among those responsible for municipal roads were not enough to keep a speed map updated. It seems that in the midst of employees? busy work days with road authorities tasks like speed map updates are given low priority and are not carried out. This being so, it may be concluded that keeping a high quality speed map updated on a voluntary basis is not practicable. Mandatory maintenance by municipalities is a prerequisite for a high quality speed map. We recommend an amendment to road law making it mandatory for road authorities to make a digital map of the roads ? including speed limits - available to the public. There is an urgent need for that ? not only regarding any future ISA concepts, but also in a broader perspective involving road pricing or dynamic congestion information.   ? 9 ?Future directions were considered before the end of the PAYS project. The good examples of Open Map and Wikipedia, which enable anonymous users to contribute their input to create a legitimate content, were promising. The development of such a scheme would provide the opportunity to involve speed conscious drivers in maintaining the speed map. PAYS participants could be awarded a reduction in penalty points for correct speed limit sign changes. Obviously, all changes made by unauthorized people should be verified before implementation. However, it could also lead to a tool misuse, when wrong, speed limit would be marked - it seems reasonable that drivers would report in, if a too low speed limit frustrate them, rather than if a speed limit was recorded higher than it is in reality.   A first step towards availability of rich road feature data will be taken in Denmark. The Danish Road Directorate and seven suburban municipalities in the outskirts of the Danish capital Copenhagen are currently involved in a trial with the purpose of creating updated road maps which are reliable concerning a number of attributes, as for example speed limits (17). It is an ambitious project and it will be interesting to see how close towards a fully updated road map they will get via the approaches adopted.

We focused on high -frequency (HF: 0.15¨C0.4 Hz) components related to parasympathetic conditions and proposed a two index estimation method for depicting drowsiness using peak values of frequency spectrum components. In a driving simulator experiment, our drowsiness detection system had an accuracy of approximately 80%, compared with the method described by NEDO (1)(7)(8)(9(10). However, based on our experiment, the drowsiness scale varies according to the individual and should be prepared either before the driver gets into the vehicle or after driving for a few minutes. In this paper, we explain how to set a personalized drowsiness scale for each driver allowing the application of our method in actual vehicles.  KEYWORDS Drowsiness Detection, Heartbeat Fluctuation, Autonomic Nerve, RSA, Driving Simulator  DROWSINESS DETECTION SYSTEM The drowsiness detection system is shown in Fig. 1. First, our system calculates the R-wave to R-wave interval (RRI) (Fig. 2) using heartbeat signals from a biosensor. Secondly, the frequency of the RRIs is analyzed and the autonomic nervous system activity is evaluated. Low frequency (LF: 0.05¨C0.15 Hz) relates to both the sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, whereas high frequency relates only to the parasympathetic tone (Fig. 3). We focused on the peak HF spectrum component and used our two unique indexes to estimate the drowsiness 2 level. One index shows the excitement level (based on frequency) and the other index shows the awareness level (based on power spectral density (PSD) values). Our system then classifies the drowsiness into 5 levels (level 1: aware to level 5: extremely drowsy) using the two indices and creates a drowsiness state graph (Fig. 4).  Driving Simulator Experiments In order to evaluate our algorithm, we administered a drowsy test for drivers using a driving simulator. The driving experiment was performed for a total of 80 minutes and consisted of three parts. The first 20 minutes involves high speed driving, the next 40 minutes part involves low speed driving, and the final 20 minutes again involves high speed driving. Drivers tend to be alert during high speed driving and sleepy during low speed driving. During experiments, we simultaneously recorded several kinds of vital data, such as their heartbeat and some videos (of the driver¡¯s body, face, and simulator display (road)). Fig. 5 shows an example of the results. In Fig. 5, the numbers indicate the time that has elapsed after the driver has begun to drive the car.  Drowsiness Evaluation Index In order to evaluate our algorithm, we used the drowsiness index provided by the Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) as a reference (4). The NEDO index indicates the drowsiness level based on the facial expression of the driver using a person¡¯s subjective judgments (this is called the ¡°NEDO evaluation¡± or ¡°NEDO criteria¡±). The NEDO evaluation has five levels of drowsiness (Table 1) so we generated our reference data from a driving video. The detection accuracy of the experiment is calculated by:                                      (1)  where ni is the reference and fi is the detection result at a unit time i. S is the level of the reference, so S = 5, which is the maximum value defined by NEDO. We obtained an average accuracy rate of 79.3% using data from 54 experiments.  *NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization)  DROWSINESS SCALE ASSIGNMENT To evaluate our algorithm, we recruited 100 drivers to use driving simulators in the experiment. Each driver had an individual drowsiness scale. Our analysis was not done in real 3 time and the data used ranged from wide awake to different drowsy states in driving simulator experiments before the first case involving actual driving. However, it is preferred that the system works immediately even in the first driving scenario so that it can be put into practical use. To solve this, the drowsiness scale should be set before the first episode of driving, or set a few minutes after driving begins. For the latter method, the system reported that there was a correlation between the states of alertness and drowsiness. The drowsiness scale was set automatically by assuming that the driver was awake just after getting into the vehicle. However, this would be inaccurate if the driver is initially drowsy when he or she gets into the vehicle. Therefore, there has to be an initial benchmark to represent the state of wakefulness and drowsiness for each person. First, the position of wakefulness is chosen. Secondly, the drowsiness scale can be composed according to the position of wakefulness. (10)  The particular characteristic considered by the algorithm is related to the respiratory fluctuation component or respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), which influences a driver's heartbeat fluctuation (Fig. 7). It is known that the source of RSA is the respiratory center, and baroreceptor reflection relates to the blood pressure and nervus vagus (Fig. 8). When the state is relatively steady at rest (assumed to be the point at which the driver enters the vehicle), interference from the respiratory center is especially large. The system thought that the position specified the wakefulness position of our algorithm by acquiring the RSA managed by the respiratory center before driving for the first time.  The following two methods were examined. 1) Method of using a simple sphygmograph (electrocardiograph) for calculations.  The respiratory frequency and the RSA amplitude (corresponding to the horizontal axis of the drowsiness scale) are calculated from the sphygmograph measurements. 2) Method that uses a memorized number of heartbeats for calculations. The respiratory frequency (corresponding to the horizontal axis when awake) is presumed from the number of heartbeats, and the RSA amplitude (corresponding to the vertical axis when awake) is calculated from the results.  EVALUATION We first explain Method 1. Fig. 9 shows the RRI  that was acquired with the subject in a stable state. The horizontal axis indicates the RRI and the vertical axis shows the duration. It is observed that RRI decreases with inspiration and increases with expiration This is called RSA (Fig. 10). The cycle of this wave corresponds to the respiratory frequency and the amplitude, which is described as RSA in Figs. 9 and 10, and corresponds to the frequency spectrum density. Fig. 11 shows how to set the initial point in the drowsiness state graph. Due to the fact that the 4 RRI decreases with inspiration and increases with expiration, the wave is similar to a sine wave. The period of a signal corresponds to the wave for inspiration. In other words, a period of RSA represents a period of inspiration, so it should correspond to the Frequency axis in the horizontal axis of the drowsiness transition graph. Also, the amplitude of RSA is itself a period that should correspond to the axis of PSD in its vertical axis. Firstly, Fig. 12 denotes the correlation between a period of RSA and the frequency of the graph to determine a horizontal initial point. There were 3 subjects and the correlation between these two parameters was high (0.93).  Secondly, Fig. 13 shows the correlation between the amplitude of RSA and the PSD of the graph to determine an initial vertical point. There were also 3 subjects and the correlation between these two parameters was very high (0.99).  In this way, we obtained a very high correlation when we examined the relationship between the initial set point and RSA when respiration was relatively steady. For the vertical position of wakefulness, it can be determined from the RSA. Moreover, it was confirmed that there was a similar correlation between heartbeat fluctuation and the respiratory frequency. As a result, it was confirmed that the position of wakefulness is acquired from the simple pulse wave that was obtained before the first driving episode.  Method 2 determines the respiratory frequency (corresponding to the horizontal axis when awake) from the number of heartbeats, and calculates the horizontal position of wakefulness from RSA obtained from the results. When the driver accurately memorizes the number of heartbeats in a stable state, this method can be used. This method is the same as method 1, which determines the horizontal axis position of wakefulness from the number of heartbeats. It is known that RSA amplitude decreases with age, so the horizontal position added an age offset from the experimental data to a subject's RSA mean value. Unfortunately, this method did not exhibit significant correlation and it is thought that more subjects are required to evaluate this method correctly.  CONCLUSION In real time analysis, it is important to set the drowsiness scale for each driver. In this paper, we considered a way to determine the initial position in order to automatically set the drowsiness scale before a first episode of driving. We obtained nearly equal drowsiness scales compared with those studies that used experimental data for 3 subjects. In the future, we will analyze more data and confirm whether our algorithm can be adapted for use in real vehicles.   5  REFERENCES  (1) Ayu Miyakawa et al., ¡°Indicator for The Driver¡¯s Alertness Level Based On The Heart Rate Variability,¡± A-17-9, Proceedings of the Institution of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers Society Conference 2007, Tottori, Japan, Sep. 12, 2007 (in Japanese).

We carried out a driving experiment with driving simulator. We investigated the relationship between our respiratory intervals with increase in drowsiness. Our hypothesis was that there might be a relationship between controlling the respiratory interval and its effect on the drowsiness. Therefore, we carried out experiments with five test subjects. We found that the respiratory intervals tended to increase with increasing drowsiness. As a result, lowering the respiratory interval to half of the normal (which is around 3.5 - 4 sec) positively correlated with delaying drowsiness.  Keywords: Drowsiness, Breath, Respiratory interval   INTRODUCTION  Traffic accidents caused by drowsy driving can be deadly because drowsy drivers cannot carry out evasive actions. The detection of drowsy driving has therefore been studied actively. Besides, sensing technologies to detect the biomedical signals of drivers are continuing to progress. There is a study that measures driver breathing using car seat (1). In fact breathing is one biomedical signal that can be measured comparatively easily while any one is driving. However, reported literature does not have anything specific on the relationship between drowsiness and respiration (respiratory interval in particular). Therefore, in this paper, we investigated their relationship. Since we can easily control breathing up to a certain limit¡¢we investigated its influence on driver¡þs drowsiness by controlling breathing interval. -2-  DROWSINESS SCALE  We needed to evaluate drowsiness to investigate relationship between drowsiness and respiratory interval. Zilberg¡þs ¡°drowsiness level¡± (2) and KITAJIMA¡þs ¡°Rated sleepiness based on facial expression¡± (3) has shown the method to evaluate drowsiness. In Zilberg¡þs method, several human evaluators evaluate drowsiness from pre-recorded facial expression and body movements on a scale of one to five (2). The Table.1 and Figure.1 is evaluation criterion of drowsiness.  Tab.1.

Occasional yawning. 2 Moderately drowsy Occasional disruption of eye focus; Significant increase in the eye blink duration; Disappearance of eye blink patterns observed during the alert state; Reduction on the degree of eye opening; Occasional disappearance of facial tone; Episodes without any body movements. 3 Significantly drowsy Discernible episodes of almost complete eye closure, eyes are never fully open; Significant disruption of eye focus; Periods without any body movements (longer than for level 2) and facial tone followed by abrupt large body movements. 4 Extremely drowsy Significant increase in duration of the eye closure episodes; Longer durations of episodes with no body movements and sometimes followed by large isolated ¡°correction¡± movements -3-  In this paper, two or three human evaluators rated recorded video of driving in front of a driving simulator every10 seconds. Their average rating was defined as ¡þdrowsiness scale¡þ .    RESPIRATORY CHANGE BY DROWSINESS  We carried out a driving experiment to investigate the change in respiratory interval by increase in drowsiness.  Two test subjects volunteered. Each of them was subjected to three experiments, for a total of six experimental episodes.   Experimental Method The experiment was carried out with driving simulator. The course was projected toward the front of the projector screen. Figure 2 shows the configuration of the driving simulator. The driving course selected was a monotonous circular road, designed to increase drowsiness. Figure 3 is the driving course showing night time, circular route with no other car.  We instructed each subject to drive at about 80[km/h] on the center lane of a 3-lane road. There were no other vehicles. The experiment finished when subjects had drowsiness well enough (by driving for 30 minutes at the least).   Fig.3.

Drowsiness Level and Video image -4-  Metrics and evaluation method We measured each subject¡þs respiratory interval and facial expression. Respiratory interval was measured by a Respiratory Belt Transducer which was fitted to their abdomen. Subject¡þs facial was recorded by the camera in front of them. The drowsiness scale was evaluated by three human evaluators and their average rating was rounded off, resulting in an integer from 0 to 4. We evaluated the average respiratory interval at each drowsiness scale. The average respiratory interval was defined as the average of the last 60 seconds.  Result   We averaged all 6 sets of the average respiratory interval at each drowsiness scale. The results are shown in Figure 4 .  We know that the respiratory interval increases when we are sleeping. Our hypothesis was that this relationship may hold true while someone is drowsy (though not exactly in sleep) too. The average respiratory interval of each of our test subject appeared to confirm this in our experiments too. Thus we would suggest that the average respiratory intervals tended to increase with increasing drowsiness. Therefore, we examined whether there is any beneficial effect on delaying drowsiness by controlling the breath interval.   THE EFECT OF BREATH CONTROL   We carried out a driving experiment to investigate the effect of breath control on driver¡þs drowsiness. This time we had five volunteers.   22.533.540 1 2 3 4Respiratory interval[sec]Drowsiness scale Fig.4. Changing of drowsiness scale and Respiratory interval -5- EXPERIMENTAL METHOD We carried out driving experiment with the same driving simulator and the same driving course .We instructed each subject to drive at about 80[km/h] on the center lane of a 3-lane road. There were no other vehicles.  The breath controls were initiated from the time when the driver¡þs drowsiness scale became ¡°2¡±, for a duration of 2 minutes. Data were taken for each while performing (a) normal breathing (b) 30% lowered respiratory interval of one¡þs rest state, and (c) 50% lowered respiratory interval of one¡þs rest state. The breath controls carried out with each sounds of a metronome. When drowsiness scale became ¡°3¡±, the experiment was ended. Why we selected only these two states of lowered respiratory intervals, namely 30% and 50%, and not others like say 20% and 40%? Or even say, 70%? The answer lies in our experience with different period of breathing experiments. While doing these experiments, we learned that for a normal person, with average breath duration of around 3.6 seconds, it really does not matter much if the duration is decreased by around 0.5 sec or so. We can not also lower the respiratory interval below say, 1.5 sec for safety reasons. So these two points set a kind of restriction on us, while we are seeking safe, yet we may have some effect.  METRICS During the experiments, we measured subject¡þs facial expression, distance from the center lane and the Electroencephalogram (EEG). Subject¡þs facial was recorded by the camera in front. The distance from the center lane was measured by the driving simulator. The EEG was measured at Pz (Figure 5) based on the ten-twenty electrode system. The drowsiness scale was evaluated by two human evaluators.   EVALUATION METHOD We evaluated the effect of breath control. From the drowsiness scale we evaluated the length of the vigilance duration from the moment the subject¡þs drowsiness scale became ¡°2¡± until the experiment was ended (Figure 6). It has used the previous study (4) Fp1 Fp2F8F4FzF3F7T4C4CzC3T3A2A1T6P4PzP3T5O1 O2 Fig.5. EEG location -6-   In addition, we calculated standard deviations of distance from center lane in breath control and 2 minutes prior to breath control. Similar experiment using fragrance was done by Kakamu et al (5). We evaluated the rate of change of each standard deviation (Figure 7). For comparison, we calculated standard deviations at normal breath in the same way.   Furthermore, we conducted a frequency analysis of EEG. Additionally, we calculated the ratio (¦Á/¦Â) of ¦Á wave (8~13Hz) to ¦Â wave (14Hz~30Hz) in breath control and 2 minutes prior to breath control. The rate of change of each ¦Á/¦Â was defined as EEG_change_rate.   RESULTS Figure 8 shows the average duration of all five test subjects while the driver is vigilant (called vigilance duration) in each of the experiment.  200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600-1.2-1-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.200.20.40.6Distance from the center lane [m]Standard deviations Breath control Time[sec] Fig.7.

By lowering respiratory interval to 50%, EEG_change_rate got reduced compared to that of no breath control.  DISCUSSIONS  The above section (Results), shows that the length of the vigilance duration, or drowsiness was decreased by lowering respiratory interval to 50% compared to that of no breath control. Furthermore, as a result of rate of change of each standard deviation, the vehicle¡þs departure from the lane-center was also decreased by lowering respiratory interval to 50% compared to that of no breath control. The vehicle¡þs departure from the lane-center tended to increase with increasing drowsiness. In addition, as a result of EEG_change_rate, ¦Á/¦Â was decreased by lowering respiratory interval to 50% compared to that of no breath control. ¦Á/¦Â has known tendency of increasing with increasing drowsiness (3).  For this reason, it is likely that the drowsiness was decreased by lowering respiratory interval to 50% compared to that of no breath control. -15.0%-10.0%-5.0%0.0%5.0%10.0%15.0%Standard Control_30Control_50¦Á/¦Âä»¯ÂÊEEG_change_rate Fig.10.

The respiratory intervals tended to increase with increasing drowsiness. Our hypothesis was that there might be a relationship between controlling the respiratory interval and its effect on the drowsiness. Therefore, we carried out experiments with five test subjects. Our data shows that there is a positive correlation between lowering the normal interval of breathing into half, which in effect increased the vigilance duration by 1.5 times compared to that of no breath control.

1  Low Attention Driving Detection Methodology for Adaptation of Driver Assistance Systems  Shintaro Saigo, Pongsathorn Raksincharoensak and Masao Nagai Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology 2-24-16 Naka-cho Koganei Tokyo 184-8588 JAPAN +81-42-388-7419, saigo.s.tuat@gmail.com  ABSTRACT Most of road accidents are mainly caused by driving distraction or inattention. This paper proposes a methodology to detect low attention state based on an individual driver reference model in car-following state. First, a driver-vehicle reference model in car-following state, treating the host vehicle and the preceding vehicle as a 1-DOF spring-mass-damper system, is used to express the normative driving of the driver. Next, low attention driving state is detected by comparing the current driving data with the value estimated by the reference model. Finally, the validity of the proposed objective evaluation is investigated by comparing to subjective evaluation of drivers and video image of the driver¡¯s facial expression during driving on highway.  INTRODUCTION More than 35% drivers who caused an accident drove in low attention state such as drowsy driving. However, most of existing assistance systems is not designed to adapt to the low attention state but designed to adapt to the normative state of the driver. So the assistance given by such systems may be too late for the driver whose attention level is degraded cause of sleepiness to avoid accident risk. To realize the high acceptable driving assistance system, the system is required to consider the driver attention level changing momentarily in addition to the physical collision risk surrounding the vehicle. The main goal of the driver assistance system is to provide information, issue warning to drivers in necessary situations adapted to the driving environment and the driver state as shown in Figure 1 (1)(2)(3). In the previous research(4)(5)(6), the authors give the understandings that it is important for the design of Human-Machine-Interface adapted to an individual driver and various types of driving environment. Moreover, it is important to study on naturalistic driver model based on sensing naturalistic driving data in real-world traffic situation by learning data history of the 2  individual driver, as one of advanced driver assistance systems to prevent collisions. Estimating driver state is a key issue to improve driver acceptance in using driver assistance systems. Previously in our laboratory, the hurry driving detection has been succeeded by comparing the current driving data with the driver model made by using the statistical data-driven which is the probability distribution of acceleration and headway distance at the normative driving(7). Then, this study focuses on the car-following situation from the viewpoint of the rear-end collision prevention, and proposes the methodology of detecting the degraded state from normative driving. First, the characteristics such as naturalistic headway distance and normative car-following performance are extracted the driving data collected by using a continuous logging drive recorder. Next, the degraded performance for following task are detected by comparing the current driving data with the driver model relevant to the longitudinal vehicle dynamics based on the extracted characteristics. Figure 2 shows the conceptual diagram of a safe headway assistance system based on adaptive control theory. The emphasis of this study is that the degraded driving is not detected directly from physiological measurement, but from the driving behavior deviated from the normative characteristics considering the transfer function from the environment to the driving operation. Boer et al. proposed the steering entropy algorithm to quantify driver efforts to maintain their lateral safety margin using the steering angle data(8). In addition, the low attention state can be detected by the criterion of the individual driver, it will be able to realize that the assistance system is not only adapted to the various types of drivers, but also adapted to the driver attention level. The information of driver state can be utilized to determine the appropriate way to assist the drivers such as the information guidance, driving advisory, collision warning or intervention operation, in order to improve the driver acceptance of the system.

Schematic diagram of individual adaptive headway control assistance system  CAR-FOLLOWING DRIVING DATA COLLECTION In order to construct and to verify the car-following reference model, the long-term real world driving data was collected by using the experimental car equipped with the continuous logging drive recorder. The continuous drive recorder consists of the information of road environment (GPS data and headway distance), driver operation (steering, pedal, winker), and vehicle dynamics data (speed, acceleration, yaw rate, etc.). The six video images of front scenery, rear scenery, driver¡¯s face and driver¡¯s foot motion in pedal operation are captured in synchronization with the sensor data. The configuration of the continuous logging drive recorder is shown in Figure3.   Figure 3.

Other researches about driver behavior analysis by using driver facial information exist a lot, and then this study uses the NEDO drowsy level that is effective of judging the driver sleepiness objectively from the facial image(9). The NEDO drowsy level is defined as shown in Table 1, it assesses the driver sleepiness in five levels. To acquire a certain amount of car-following data, driving data of an individual driver was collected by driving through the determined route. The subject drivers were a university faculty member and a student, and there was no specific instruction for driving. The analysis targets are the driving data when the time headway is less than 5 seconds and when the following state continues for 2 minutes.  Table 1. NEDO drowsiness level grading   MODELING OF CAR FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR This study proposes the reference driver model based on assumption that the driver maintains a safe distance between a preceding vehicle and the host vehicle. In this model, both vehicles are connected with a virtual spring and a virtual damper as shown in the pictorial diagram in Figure 4. This model is not considered about road grade, width of road, number of lane and weather. This model is simple, but it is utilized as the algorithm for autonomous platoon driving(10), and it will be possible to estimate the individual adaptive driving behavior by tuning the parameter in this model. The motion equation of this model is as follows: 1 2 3 4 5Completely awake Slightly sleepy Visibly sleepyFalling asleepintermittentlyAlmost completelyasleep¡þThe movement ofeyes is fast andfrequent.¡þThe cycle of theblink is constant.¡þThe movement ofthe glance is slow.¡þThe lip opens.¡þThe head is laid onthe headrest¡þIt yawns small.¡þThe movement ofeyes is slow andfrequent.¡þthe mouth moves.¡þIt yawns big.¡þAn intentionalblink is done.¡þThe blink and themovement of theglance are slow.¡þThe head isshaken.¡þThe yawn happensfrequently.¡þThe eyelid is shut.¡þThe head inclinesforward orbackward5   ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ ¡þ¡þtRHVRtRHta mVmmRm¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ **  (1) where, am* denotes the reference longitudinal acceleration of host vehicle, Rm denotes the headway distance as output from the model, R* denotes the objective headway distance varied among individuals, Vm denotes the host vehicle velocity as output from the model, R¡þdenotes the relative velocity as input to the model, HR and HV denote dynamic parameters that change depending on the interpersonal driving condition. Figure 5 shows the control law of the headway distance as the block diagram based on equation (1). The parameters in Figure 5 vary with each driver, so they are identified by using the real-world driving data.   Figure 4. Pictorial diagram of car-following state   Figure 5.

Degraded driving is detected by comparing the current driving data with the value estimated from the driver reference model, and this system may give an advisory message or issue some warning to the driver. So the system is able to assist the driver with individual parameters, and the system is adaptable to various driver types: novice, expert and also elderly drivers.

For these figures, the outputs from the reference model fit well with the measured data, so it can be said that the parameters tuning were appropriate and the reference model can estimate the normative driving from only the preceding vehicle velocity input.

Simulation result of reference model at normal driving  LOW ATTENTION DRIVING DETECTION ALGORITHM This section verifies whether the proposed reference driver model can detect the degraded driving state by comparing the current driving data with the value estimated from the driver reference model in the same specific circumstances. The degraded driving data used for verification is the data that the result of assessing the driver sleepiness in five levels from the facial image was more than 2 (except ¡°completely awake¡±). The reference driver-vehicle system model outputs are compared with the real measured data at degraded driving. Figure 8 shows the time-history data of the driver A and the driver B. Each figure shows the time history of the velocity and the headway distance from above of these figures. The solid lines in these figures indicate the measured data, the dashed lines indicate the outputs from the reference driver model, and the gray line in the upper graph shows the preceding vehicle velocity which is an input of the driver-vehicle system. For these figures, the measured data do not fit the data from the reference model, and they tend to increase and significant difference between two driving states could be noticed. This is thought to be due to the degradation of the headway control performance with respect to the 57 107 157 20710203040Time [s] Preceding  vehicle and host vehicle  velocity     [m/s]      VVpVm57 107 157 207020406080100120Time [s]  Headwaydistance    [m]      RRm1648 1698 174810203040Time [s] Preceding  vehicle and host vehicle  velocity     [m/s]      VVpVm1648 1698 1748020406080100120Time [s]  Headwaydistance    [m]      RRm8  preceding vehicle behavior, which corresponds to the low attention level. Using these results, tendency of increasing the headway distance at low attention state is assessed, the detecting method of degraded driving is considered by using distribution of deviation between the measured headway distance and the reference model. The distributions of deviation at the deviated driving from the reference model are shown in Figure 9. ¡þR [-] and ¡þV [-] in these figures are the normalized deviation of the headway distance and the vehicle velocity as follows:  ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þtVtVtVtmmV¡þ¡þ¡þ , ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þtRtRtRtmmR¡þ¡þ¡þ  (4) where, V denotes the host vehicle velocity and R denotes the headway distance. The solid lines in each graph, which those lines are referred as ¡°Model¡±, indicate the deviation approximated as the normal distribution from the reference model at normative driving. In other words, they can be interpreted as model error at normative driving.      (a) Driver A, Dataset No. 41               (b) Driver B, Dataset No. 24 Figure 8. Simulation result of reference model at degraded driving  The distributions of the state deviation (headway and velocity) in the degraded driving state shown in Figure 9 describes that the both deviations are flatter than the solid lines indicating the normative driving. It means that the driver attention to the preceding vehicle is lower than normal driving. In such case, the low performance of the driver for the primary task, i.e. driving, may cause near-miss incidents or crashes if there is unexpected situation such as hard brake events of a preceding vehicle. According to this result, it is thought that the degraded driving state can be quantitatively estimated by assessing the distribution of deviation between the measured headway distance and the reference model. 2449 2499 254910203040Time [s] Preceding  vehicle and host vehicle  velocity     [m/s]      VVpVm2449 2499 2549020406080100120Time [s]  Headwaydistance    [m]      RRm1966 2016 206610203040Time [s] Preceding  vehicle and host vehicle  velocity     [m/s]      VVpVm1966 2016 2066020406080100120Time [s]  Headwaydistance    [m]      RRm9    (a) Driver A, Dataset No. 41               (b) Driver B, Dataset No. 24 Figure 9. Comparison of velocity and headway deviation of vehicle behavior between the reference model and the degraded driving  DIAGNOSIS OF THE DEGRADED DRIVING In pre-section, it was shown that the qualitative assessment of distribution of deviation between the measured headway distance and the reference model can utilize to detect the degraded driving state. This section describes the quantitative assessment method of distribution of deviation and result of assessing. The index ¡þR which normalizes the deviation of the headway distance is used for the assessment of the degraded driving. The temporal change of the distribution of the index ¡þR is analyzed every 10 seconds from the previous 60-second time window. Based on this methodology, the distribution of deviation of the current headway distance from the reference model is compared with the model error approximated as the normal distribution in order to estimate the current attention level of the driver quantitatively. Actually, the estimated attention level is defined as the average of the two values shown in equation (7), that are quantified based on the approximated normal distribution as shown in equation (5) and (6).  11 ¡þ¡þ¡þmmcurrentP¡þ¡þ¡þ (5)  mcurrentP¡þ¡þ¡þ2  (6)  ¡þ ¡þ221 PPP¡þ¡þ  (7) where, P1 denotes the estimated attention level corresponding to the shift of average, P2 -0.1 0 0.1010203040¡þVProbability [%]  DegradedModel-1 0 1010203040¡þRProbability [%]  DegradedModelN = 4245 N = 4245 N = 4387 N = 4387-0.1 0 0.1010203040¡þVProbability [%]  DegradedModel-1 0 1010203040¡þRProbability [%]  DegradedModel10  denotes the estimated attention level corresponding to the dispersion, ¡þcurrent denotes the average of model error of the current headway distance, ¡þm denotes the average of model error of the reference model, ¡þcurrent denotes the dispersion of model error of the current headway distance, ¡þm denotes the dispersion of model error of the reference model, P denotes the comprehensive estimated attention level which is quantified in five levels from the higher.

In the case of driver A, 63.64% degraded driving could be detected correctly, 80.00% degraded driving could be detected in the case of driver B. Conversely, up to 40% normative driving data are judged as degraded driving, this algorithm may give the driver irritations. Therefore, the accuracy improvement is needed as well as the proposed algorithm is valid for the detection of the degraded driving.  Table 3.

This study focuses on the car-following situation, first, the reference driver model which can represent the normative driving was proposed. Actually, the host vehicle behavior can be treated as the spring-mass-damper system with respect to the preceding vehicle by the correct identification of the driver parameters in the reference model by using the real-world car-following data. Next, the diagnosis method of the degraded driving was considered by using the driving data of the two drivers. In the result, the degraded driving state correlates with the deviation from the average and the root mean square of the distribution of deviation from the reference driver model, which is effective for the degraded driving diagnosis. Additionally, the degraded driving can be detected in real time by monitoring the temporal change of that distribution. In future, the reference model considered only longitudinal direction will be combined with the lateral control behavior of drivers for high accuracy detection of the degraded driving, and then driver distraction which mainly occurred at low attention state will be analyzed in detail.

It is assumed that the tolerance to driver¡¯s mental workload is different depending on the individual. Therefore, we classify people based on their individual tolerance to mental workload. Our estimation method is multiple linear regression analysis, and we compare it to NASA-TLX which is u sed as the evaluation method of subject ive mental workload. A s a result, the coefficient of correlation improved from R=0.83 to 0.91, and the standard deviation of error als o i mproved. The refore, our pr oposed method demonstrated the  po ssibility to estimate mental workload quantitatively.  Keywords: Driver mon itoring, Heart rate variability, multiple line ar re gression analysis, NASA-TLX, Mental workload   INTRODUCTION  While driving, the tasks that drivers perform in addition to the actual driving has increased. Examples include operation of car n avigation system and conversation using cellular phone. However, such tasks while driving ca uses the dr iver¡¯s attenti on to decr ease. These conversations etc. are men tal workload for the driv er, and hav e reportedly  been causing serious accident s. Th erefore, many studies concerning m ental workload de tection were  reported (1). Many preceding studies assume the driver is in either of the two states; normal or under mental workload. However, various factors contribute to the mental workload, and the level of mental workload given to the driver is different depending on the type of mental workload. Therefore, when think ing about the practicality  of mental work load detectio n systems, it is preferable for them to be evaluated quantitatively. The evalu ation methods of mental workload are mainly driver¡¯s own subjectivity assessment, the change of physiological indexes, and performance of secondary task.   In this study, we estimated driver¡¯s mental workload using the heart rate v ariability- which has close relations with a mental activity and we co mpared it to the NASA-TLX w hich is used as the evaluation method of subjective mental workload to validate our estimated results.    -2-  PHYSIOLOGICAL INFORMATION  Influence of Subtask to Physiological Information  To det ect and evaluate driver¡¯s mental workload, phy siological information (e.g.  electrocardiogram (ECG), visual information and brain wave) is applied b y a lot of studie s. Abe et al. (2) have ev aluated t he v ariation of  heart rat e du ring th e driving with mental arithmetic tasks. They have referred to the increment of heart rate in mental arithmetic tasks. Takahashi et al. (3) have reported that the driver¡¯s pupil expands when secondary tasks such as arithmetic or word memory is imposed while driving simultaneously. However, they have described that there is no significant difference in the variation between imposed subtasks. In fact, it could be difficult to identify the level of mental workload with only one feature.  Our hypothesis is that quantification of mental workload is possible by capturing the variation of several features comprehensively. We extracted features from some heart rate v ariability that are influenced by the mental workload.  Feature Extraction from Electrocardiogram  Activity of the heart is known to relate to the level of mental workload (4). Especially, R-R Interval (RRI) which is the time interval between two consecutive R-waves in ECG, is widely used to evaluate mental workload and can calculate various indexes. For example, Takatsu et al. (5) hav e describ ed that the Co efficient of Variation of  the  R-R intervals (C VRR) is  affected by parasympathetic nervous activities. Figure 1 shows RRI of ECG.

(6) have described that the Trough and Peak (TP) which is the rate of trough and peak wave in time series data of RRI is concerned with mental workload. Similarly, they have described that the DSDa (which is t he stand ard dev iation of the absolute in f irst order derivative from ti me serie s data of RRI), DSDp  ( which is th e s tandard d eviation of the  positive value in first order derivative from time series data of RRI) and DSDn (which is the standard deviation of the negative value in first order derivative from time series data of RRI) is concerned with mental workload.   -3-  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100-0.25-0.2-0.15-0.1-0.0500.050.10.150.20.25Difference of RRItime(s)DRRRRIi-RRIi-1Time(s)¡þDSDa¡þDSDp¡þDSDn0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.500.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.1Power spectrum of R-R Interval(Hz)(s2 / Hz)TFHFLFF1 F2 F3 F4MFLFpHFp Figure 3. First order derivative of RRI                 Figure 4. Power spectrum of HRV  Power spectrum of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be acquired by analyzing RRI data. We obtain Low Frequency (LF) components between 0.04Hz and 0.15Hz, High Frequency (HF) components between 0.15Hz and 0.45Hz and Total Frequency (TF) co mponents between 0.04Hz and 0.45Hz fro m HRV signal s. Pomeranz et al. (7) have de scribed that LF  components are influenced by sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activities, and HF components are affected b y pa rasympathetic nervous activities. T hey represented the Sympathetic Nervous Activity (SNA) as HF/LF and the Pa rasympathetic Nervous Activity (PNA) as HF . Yamada et al.

(9) have described that Low Frequency Peak (LF p) and H igh Frequency Peak (HFp) becomes higher while a driver is also doing arithmetic sum. Ther efore, it is assumed that LFp and HFp are concerned with mental workload. Also, we obtain Frequency 1 (F1) components between 0.05Hz and 0.15Hz, Frequency 2 (F2) components between 0.15Hz and 0.25Hz, Frequency 3 (F3) components between 0.25Hz and 0.35Hz and Frequency 4 (F4) components between 0.35Hz and 0.45Hz from HRV signals. Heart Rate Variability 1 (HRV1) is the ratio of F1 and TF . Heart Rate Variability 2 (HRV2) is the ratio of F2 and TF. H eart Rate Variability 3 (HRV3) is the ratio of F3 and TF. Heart Rate Variability 4 (HRV4) is the ratio of F4 and TF. Murata (10) have described that these features are useful to examine the relationship between heart rate variability and breath in state of mental workload.   In this study, we re-sample RRI data at 2Hz with third order spline interpolation and estimate power spectrum with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We also us e the features of t he mean value of heart rate (HR), CVRR, TP , DSDa, DSDp, DSDn, SN A, PNA, MF, LFP, HFP, HRV1, HRV2, HRV3 and HRV4.   SUBJECTIVE MENTAL WORKLOAD EVALUATION METHOD  Adaptive NASA-TLX  NASA-TLX (National Aeronautics and Spac e A dministration Task Load Index) w as developed by Ames Research Center in NASA. It is a tool to evaluate subjective mental workload and has been used widely in some preceding studies (11). The detail is given below. NASA-TLX is shown in Table 1 and consists of six evaluation items (Mental Demand (MD), Physical Demand (PD), Temporal Demand (TD), Own Performance (OP), EFfort (EF) and FRustration level (FR)). Subjects self-evaluate on a scale of one to twenty that has low/high  -4-  or good/poor rating on each item. The characteristic of NASA-TLX involve use of weighting coefficients that are calculated from these six factors. In this  study, we use th e Adaptive Weighted Workload (AWWL ) which is an im proved version of NASA-TLX. AWWL was suggested by Miyake and Kumashiro (12). Weight of each ite m in AWWL is determined by their rank. Summation of rate of weighted items is divided by 21, and mean value of score in each item that has a 0-100 range is obtained as AWWL score.  Table 1 NASA-TLX rating scale and definition (1)    ESTIMATION METHOD OF MENTAL WORKLOAD  Classification of Drivers by Tolerance to Mental Workload  Whether to  receive a mental load li ghtly or not dep ends on th e ind ividual because  the tolerance to a mental load is different depending on the individual. In this study, we calculate the difference between the AWWL (Adaptive Weighted Workload) score. We calculate it first in the absence of mental workload, then again under mental workload and finally, calculate the difference of these two scores. Based on the median of these differences in scores, half of our 18 test subjects (high differences in score) were classified as ¡°Class without the tolerance to a mental workload¡± and the other half of our test subjects whose difference of the two scores was low were classified into ¡°Class with the tolerance to a mental workload¡±.  Multiple Linear Regression  We estimate AWWL score from the heart rate variability using the multiple linear regression analysis. Mu ltiple l inear regress ion analy sis c an cons truct th e e stimation model which  quantitatively forecast a s pecific variable. T herefore, i t is as sumed that  multiple linear regression analysis is effective for quantitative estimation in mental workload.   Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between explanatory variables x1, x2, ..., xp and a response variable y by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Formally, the model of multiple linear regressions, given n (i=1,2,¡­,n) observed data, is  (1) Title Endpoints Descriptions MENTAL DEMAND Low/High How much mental an d perc eptual a ctivity was  required?

In this study, independent variable is the AWWL score and explanatory variables are indexes of heart rate variability.   Evaluation Indexes  We evaluate the relationship between estimated value of AWWL and true score of AWWL by a correlation of coefficient (R) and a stand ard deviation of error (SDE). These indexes are obtained by the following equations. xi is estimated AWWL score, yi is true AWWL score.  ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þniiniiniiiyyxxyyxxR12121)()())(( (2) iiinii xyeeenSDE ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ,)(112 (3)   EXPERIMENT  Experiment Environment  In this study, an experiment was conducted with a driving simulator as in Figur e 5.

Driving courses (straight road, highway and suburban road)  -6-  Secondary Task  We imposed our 18  test subjects with three differe nt kind of secondary tasks, each with different level, to imitate the distracted driving caused by mental workload. The experiments were conducted first without any secondary task, and th en under the following three tasks; listening to music, conversation, and doing arithmetic in five minutes.   Listening to Music Task  Subjects listen to favorite songs which they choose before the experiment. Then, they try to listen to music intently while driving simultaneously.  Conversation Task  Subjects explain their route from home to university or to office. Then, they try to explain the buildings and landmarks in detail while driving simultaneously.  Arithmetic Task  Arithmetic task is the addition of one-digit numbers using memory called PASAT (PAced Serial Addition Task) (13). Subjects were required to add each dig it to one immediately preceding it, and state the su m out aloud while driving simultaneously. For example, the correct response for the digit sequence ¡®4, 5, 3, 9, 7¡¯ would be ¡®9, 8, 12, 16¡¯.  Subjects and Experiment Protocol  18 test subjects (16 males and 2 fem ale, 20-24 years of age) participated in this experiment. All of th em have sufficient driving experience on real-life roads. We notified all of them experimental details and the subjects had been driving the simulated driving courses for about five minutes prior to the experiment. The sequence of experiment is shown below (Figure.7). The experimental sequences consist of control (driving only), listening to music, conversation and arithmetic. Subj ects drov e for five  minutes each an d th en answered NA SA-TLX questionnaire after each driving sequence, for a total of 4 times during the whole experiment.

Estimated results of coefficient of correlation were improved from R=0.83 to 0.91 and  standard d eviation of error SDE from 10.9 t o 7.73 . Therefore, our proposed method demonstrated the poss ibility to est imate mental workload quantitatively. Our next work could possibly be verification in the change of physiological indexes (brain wave etc.), and estimating mental w orkload under a  v ariety of sec ondary tasks (operatio n of car  navigation system etc.).

The 3D Visual Interactive Simulation (3DVIS) software which forms the basis of the DS simulation technology is the award winning Japanese product ¡®UC-win/Road¡¯. Researchers will use this 3DVIS technology along with a specially designed and constructed DS hardware system to provide the virtual driver with a totally immersive and realistic driving experience, via a motion platform composed of an X table, a 6 degrees of freedom hexapod, a Y table and vibration system, plus a 360¡ã field of view screen and 3D simulation software that can accurately reproduce every possible vehicle, road and environmental condition. The result is a totally realistic and unique driving experience that was previously not possible. In addition, the DS system will have data collection capabilities that will enable the monitoring of human behaviour characteristics under a wide variety of traffic situations, emergencies and other potential driver distractions, with the overall objective of the project being the improvement of road safety in its widest sense. 2  INTRODUCTION  The development of simulation systems to reproduce the effects of driving cars, trucks and bikes has advanced significantly over the past years [1,2]. The availability of faster and lower cost computer processors and graphics cards, coupled with the development of highly interactive 3D Virtual Reality software such as UC-win/Road [3] and highly accurate vehicle dynamics packages such as CarSim [4] has led to the availability of many new and exciting DS systems.  In addition, a greater focus on driver safety with respect to car design, along with a similar focus on road safety from a driver behaviour perspective [5, 6, 7], has led to more demand for high quality drive simulation systems from both Universities, vehicle manufacturers, driving schools, emergency response and other professional driving organisations, as well as a growing number of government transport planning organisations.  DS systems that are based on the very best virtual reality technology make driver training and research fast, efficient, safe and low cost [3]. The ability to reproduce vehicle and driver conditions at will and in a realistic virtual environment make the best DS systems invaluable in both cognitive driver training and research as well as vehicle related research and design.  EXISTING RESEARCH SUMMARY In September of 2010, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a report on distracted driving fatalities for 2009. The NHTSA considers distracted driving to include some of the following as distractions: other occupants in the car, eating, drinking, smoking, adjusting radio, adjusting environmental control, reaching for object in car, and cell phone use. In 2009 in the U.S. there was a reported 5,474 people killed by distracted drivers. Of those 995 were considered to be killed by drivers distracted by cell phones. The report doesn't state whether this under or over represents the level of cell phone use amongst drivers, and whether there is a causal relationship [5] A 2003 study of U.S. crash data states that driver inattention is estimated to be a factor in between 20 to 50 percent of all police-reported crashes. Driver distraction, a sub-category of inattention, has been estimated to be a contributing factor in 8 to 13 percent of all crashes. Of distraction-related accidents, cell phone use may range from 1.5 to 5 percent of contributing factors [6]. However, large percentages of unknowns in each of those categories may cause inaccuracies in these estimations. A 2001 study sponsored by The American Automobile Association recorded "Unknown Driver Attention Status" for 41.5 percent of crashes, and 3  "Unknown Distraction" in 8.6 percent of all distraction related accidents [7]. According to NHTSA, "There is clearly inadequate reporting of crashes" [8]. Currently, "Outside person, object, event" (commonly known as rubbernecking) is the most reported cause of distraction-related accidents, followed by "Adjusting radio/cassette/CD". "Using/dialing cell phone" is eighth. The scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a cell phone versus those of talking with a passenger. The common conception is that passengers are able to better regulate conversation based on the perceived level of danger, therefore the risk is negligible. A study by a University of South Carolina psychology researcher featured in the journal, Experimental Psychology, found that planning to speak and speaking put far more demands on the brain¡¯s resources than listening. Measurement of attention levels showed that subjects were four times more distracted while preparing to speak or speaking than when they were listening [9]. The Accident Research Unit at the University of Nottingham found that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers across various driving conditions. The number of questions asked averaged slightly higher for mobile phone conversations, although results were not constant across road types and largely influenced by a large number of questions on the urban roads [10]. A 2004 University of Utah simulation study that compared passenger and cell-phone conversations concluded that the driver performs better when conversing with a passenger because the traffic and driving task become part of the conversation. Drivers holding conversations on cell phones were four times more likely to miss the highway exit than those with passengers, and drivers conversing with passengers showed no statistically significant difference from lone drivers in the simulator [11]. A study led by Andrew Parkes at the Transport Research Laboratory in the UK, also with a driving simulator, concluded that hands-free phone conversations impair driving performance more than other common in-vehicle distractions such as passenger conversations. However, some have criticized the use of simulation studies to measure the risk of cell-phone use while driving since the studies may be impacted by the Hawthorne effect [12]. A significant amount of human factors research has been conducted throughout the academic world non-more so than at the ITS centre within Leeds University in the UK. This research includes work on the effect of in-car ITS systems [13] as well as the evaluation of traffic signage to driver behaviour [14]. In addition modern DS systems have been used to assist in the physical design of new highway infrastructures [15].   4  PROJECT OBJECTIVES To develop an experimental drive simulator system that enables researchers to collect driving data under as wide a range of controlled driving and environmental conditions as possible.

The development of a multi-degree hexapod based mobile platform system, with 360¡ã wrap-round vision, controlled by the 3D VIS simulation software which also allows high fidelity reproduction of a range of real vehicle dynamics through the use of the industry standard software CarSim and TruckSim [4]  2.

Including advanced car and traffic sounds, improved graphics and lighting with an comprehensive and flexible environmental weather system  3.  The third is based on the further development of the 3D VIS simulation software that allows driver behaviour to be analysed under the widest possible range of conditions through the development of a comprehensive data collection system. In addition, this software also allows the driver experience to be replayed for further analysis.   6   DS Hexapod 8DOF Hardware System Configuration     The 6 DOF hexapod undergoing final factory testing at Bosch Rexroth     Images of the proposed final system configuration     7  RESEARCH PROJECT The overall research project is composed of three sub-projects A, B & C   PROJECT A.  DATA MONITORING & CAPTURE  Function and Action The main function of the DS multi-degree platform system is to check the driver¡¯s decentralized attention capacity under different driving conditions and thereby to examine ways to improve overall road safety. ¡þ  This is made possible due to the chosen 3D VIS software¡¯s ability to reproduce highly immersive and realistic traffic conditions, including speed and congestion ¡þ  The 3D VIS software (UC-win/Road) also enables the researchers to reproduce almost any conceivable environmental condition that a real road user would have to contend with. These conditions include rain, wind, snow, fog with the ability to control the intensity of each of these weather factors dynamically ¡þ  The 3DVIS software also enables the researchers to build 3D environments quickly and easily using a combination of digital terrain models and aerial ortho imagery. Plus these environments can be quickly and easily populated by other 3D digital models from a number of industry sources, including 3D Studio Max, Google Building Maker, SketchUP as well as from its own inbuilt modeling system. In addition the 3D VIS software UC-win/Road has a database of over 4000 3D digital models for the researchers to use. This database includes a wide range of street furniture and street signage from around the world, as well as vegetation, vehicles and people ¡þ  UC-win/Road also has an open database and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for future project customization, a key requirement of the system specification  DS System Features To examine the driver¡¯s attention capabilities, the 3D VIS DS system software also had to have the following particular capabilities:   Driver Behaviour. The reproduction of the real human driving experience, within the driving space and the ability to test and monitor a range of functions of the drivers¡¯ behaviour.  For example: ¡þ  The measurement and analysis of physiological and psychological characteristics of drivers in different traffic conditions 8  ¡þ  The ability to critically examine the influence on a driver¡¯s concentration level during a variety of different distractions, e.g. mobile phones, radio, passengers, road signage, advertising hoardings etc. ¡þ  To research the effect on traffic safety due to tiredness  Road & Traffic Safety Research Functions. The DS system also had to provide for the following road traffic safety research functions: ¡þ  A facility to enable detailed research into driving safety under changing road conditions including lighting, visibility, surface water etc. ¡þ  The ability to examine the effects on driver safety of changing road landscapes and other visual changes within the built environment such as new signage  Road Safety in Special Environmental Circumstances. The DS system also had to facilitate research into a wide range of environmental effects on traffic safety. In particular, the system research into traffic safety in bad weather conditions such as snow, strong wind and high or low temperatures etc.  General System Requirements To satisfy the requirements of the system specification the DS has to be able to: ¡þ  Reproduce complex traffic space, whilst providing the researchers with total control of all the various environmental and other extraneous parameters ¡þ  Be highly flexible and easily controlled, thereby making the actual research work more efficient and more comfortable for the individual researchers ¡þ  Designed to minimise cost by incorporating industry standard, state-of-the-art personal computer 3D VR simulation technology   PROJECT B. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION  The DS system used in this project, on which drivers¡¯ attention / deviation capabilities are to be tested and the various preventive solutions and technologies examined, is composed of the following five units: Multi projection system, Projection screen, Projection control unit (including image brightness, screen processor), Visual generation unit and the sub assembly components (pedestrian support and platform, etc.)     9  PROJECT C.  DS DESIGN SPECIFICATION      DS Functionality ¡þ  The ability to faithfully reproduce the individual vehicle¡¯s kinematics and kinetic features (turns, acceleration etc) under a wide range of driving conditions ¡þ  A software system able to reproduce the built environment and infrastructure, road networks, traffic volumes, sounds and all weather and road surface conditions ¡þ  Comprehensive data collection and analysis capabilities ¡þ  An open interface for future developments using an in-built SDK     Research Requirements    Driver Behaviour Research. The DS system must be able to reproduce the driver's driving ¡®sense¡¯ faithfully and must have the ability to log and analyse the driver's driving behaviour.   For example: ¡þ  The ability to measure and analyse driver psychologies and characteristics under various driving environments (road changes, acceleration, deceleration, breaking and changes in direction etc) ¡þ  Research the driving characteristics of various age groups (young/ old/ juvenile) ¡þ  The influence on the driver of mobile phone and radio use, etc. ¡þ  The influence of tiredness ¡þ  The influence of alcohol, disease and drugs (prescription medicine and social)    Road Safety Research. The DS system must also enable research into particular safety issues concerning a wide variety of individual road conditions.   For example:  ¡þ  The ability to reproduce all road conditions, sizes and types (long descending slopes, tunnels, bridges, doglegs, complex intersections, etc.) ¡þ  The DS system should also have the ability to assist in security and emergency planning and research ¡þ  Facilitate research into various roadway lighting, guiding and changes in visibility ¡þ  The DS VR software must enable the easy yet comprehensive design and production of 3D roads, associated infrastructure and landscape ¡þ  A road safety evaluation function for management and maintenance personnel  Road Safety Research under Special Environmental Conditions. Another DS system requirement is the ability to accurately reflect every conceivable environmental condition that 10  the road user would have to contend with. These include: fog, ice and snow, high or low temperature, snowstorm, wind and etc. In addition these environmental effects need to be able to be controlled dynamically by the researcher to show the effect of rapid or slow changes to the weather. The researcher needs to be able to switch on or off special events, such as traffic accidents, fires, smoke and other abnormal situations as well as being able to reproduce a range of potential security and emergency events  CONCLUSION The result of these 3 projects is the production of a unique multi-degree road safety driving simulator using the very latest hydraulic, electronic and 3D virtual reality technology. It has been designed to meet all the requirements of the agreed system specification, including:  ¡þ  The faithful reproduction of the driving experience through easily to use parametric controls  The multi-degree road safety DS system has the same driving interface as a real vehicle it simulates real road traffic conditions and reproduces the individual driver's driving capability.  The system will improve the level of road safety research significantly by allowing the researchers to use the single or the multi-dimensional parametric control system, as well as having a data capture and analysis system which is both versatile and accurate.  ¡þ  The ability to reproduce extremely dangerous road situations to enable researchers to expand the potential scope of their driver safety research ¡þ  The research objectives can be altered at will due to the flexible 3D VR driving environment which can be changed easily and efficiently leading to an improved research capability ¡þ  The DS system utilizes industry standard computer simulation technology and hence reduces research costs  Typical research objectives tend to be focused on traffic accidents and other road incidents. Field experiments and collision tests using real vehicles is very expensive.  However a multi-degree road safety DS system can reduce these research costs significantly whilst at the same time allowing the researcher to evaluate a whole host of ¡®human factors¡¯ through the application of the latest IT technology. 11      FINAL DS SYSTEM CONFIGURATION     The integration of Projects A & B with C results in the overall research system¡­                                   Project C Multi-Degree traffic safety Driving simulator Yaw Table 6 DOFMotion platform Visual system Audio system Cabin Control system Vibrator Project Unit Dome and screen Scene generator Scene database Motion system Motion control unit Visual control unit Sound control unit Car control unit Data collect and Communication unit Data collect system Power supply system Sub system Project A Data collect system Project B Driver distraction and  Prevention technology 12  Explosion of the Component Parts of the multi-degree 3D DS     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We must acknowledge the invaluable contribution of the staff at Bosch Rexroth, Innosimulation Inc and BARCO.

As the first step of the study, we d esigned an HMI system to preve nt stop sign viol ation at intersections because violation at intersections is a major cause of traffic accidents caused by senior drivers. The HMI system was designed to induce safe driving by notifying drivers that they are approaching an intersection and by presenting voice announcements with feedback information when he stopped at the intersection. Feed-forward was set u p to induce safe stopping at intersections. Feedback was set up to give a psychological reward to safe stopping and to induce continuous safe driving. An efficacy test on the HMI system was conducted with nine senior drivers and seven female drivers (30¡¯s to 40¡¯s) by using a driving simulator (DS). The test results showed that their starting to decelerate tended to beco me earlier with the HMI system. The evaluation of the HMI system revealed that the acceptability of the system among the drivers was significantly high. These results indicated that the HMI system was effective in inducing senior drivers to drive carefully at intersections    2  INTRODUCTION With an un precedented high rate of popu lation agi ng, tr affic accidents caused b y senior drivers have been significantly increasing in Japan (1) (2). In order to prevent these accidents effectively, it is necessary to promote hazard perception a nd safety behaviors among senior drivers. In particular, it is important to induce senior drivers to drive saf ely without anxiety (3) (4). A reminder system has been developed to give precaution statements when drivers turn corners are appreciated using by senior drivers and are contributing to decrease accidents caused by  senior drivers. The positi ve effects of t he sy stem indicate t he i mportance of inductive assistance for senior drivers.  In this study, we designed a hu man machine interface ( HMI) sy stem which p romotes awareness of surrounding hazard and induces spontaneous safe driving. As the first step of the study, we focuse d on  an HMI s ystem wh ich indu ces spontaneous safe  stopping at  intersections where accidents tend to happen most frequently. (4)(5)  DESIGN OF AN HMI An HMI system designed in this study had two m ain functions. One was to notify drivers when they are approaching an intersection. The other is to give vocal feedback information to drivers only when they stop safely at the intersection. The major four components of the HMI system are as follows. 1) At engin e starting (Pre-drive announce): a voice greeting and an instruction are given to encourage safe driving which takes 12 seconds. The greeting and instruction are   ¡°Hello, today¡¯s fortune telling predicts good luck. Your safe stop at intersections will be a key action to invite good fortune.¡± 2) Feed-forward: announcements sound and voice to notify drivers that they are approaching an intersection. The announcements are   ¡°You are approaching an intersection.¡± 3) Feedback: melody, incense and a voice message to give feedback information only when drivers stop safely at the intersection. The announcements are   ¡°Thank you for your safe and caring driving.¡± 4) At the end of driving (After-drive announce): a voice message to give feedback information for safe driving. The message is   ¡°Now, you have finished driving. Today¡¯s your driving obtained three caring points. Thank you for your safe driving.¡±   3  Pre-drive announce and after-drive announce are amusement parts. They were set up to make drivers feel communicating with the HMI system and to create a sense of intimacy with it. A sense of intimacy with the HMI was expected to bring a sense of trust to it and also continual use of it.   The Feed-forward was set up to induce safe stopping at intersections by notifying drivers that they are approaching an intersection. Announcements to notify drivers are given at 70 meters towards a stop line because the specification of the driving simulator (DS) didn¡¯t enable us to control temporally the timing.  The feedb ack i s set  u p to give  a ps ychological reward to safe st opping and to  induce continuous sa fe driving by presenting voice announce ments gi ving feedback information when he stopped at th e intersection. This f eedback mechanism w as based o n b ehavioral therapeutic theory which means that bad b ehaviors are leaned without noticing the same as good behaviors are. Consequently, unsafe dri ving (= a b ad conduct) can be improved by relearning safe driving with the HMI system and safe driving will be performed routinely by continual learning.   We set up a feedback function only to give a good account of safe driving not to give a warning of unsafe driv ing. The HMI system is designed for senior drivers to drive safely without anxiety. Accordingly, the system was developed to give a w arning to senior drivers and to make them feel stress. In addition, drivers will feel uncomfortable by getting a warning and lose their sense of intimacy with the HMI system.  EXPERIMENTAL METHOD Figure 1 shows sche matic description of drivi ng simulation settings in this experiment. A driving simulator was used to set up an experimental driving course having three intersections with stop signs and two intersections without them (Fig. 2). The subjects were asked to drive along the course watching its scenery projected on the screen. From an experimental data, we analyzed vehicle speed, angles of the accelerator pedal and stop time at the intersections by using a significant test to examine the effect of the HMI system on drivers¡¯ behavior. Figure 3 shows an image of an intersection.  4   Figure1 Schematic description of driving simulation settings           Figure 2 Course Description  Figure 3 Image of an intersection 5  PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT Prior to an experiment with senior drivers as the subjects, exploratory experiments and an evaluation of the HMI s ystem using a questionnair e were p erformed w ith seven fem ale drivers, assuming that the female drivers tend to act similarly to senior drivers in accident conditions. The subjects were female in their 30¡¯s and 40¡¯s.  With th e HMI sy stem, the dat a fro m the fe male drivers showed th at TT I (ti me to intersections) at the time of lifting foot off the acceleration pedal had increased by 24.5% (P<0.01) (Fig.4) and that the angles of the acceleration pedal at the time of running through intersections had decreased by 31.6% (P<0.01) (Fig.5). However, it was also show n that the subjects were not satisfied enough with the HMI system because the contents of the voice announcements were too long and were difficult for them to understand (Fig.6). The pre-drive announce received the lowest evaluation of inductive effects on safe driving because drivers could neither understand nor enjoy the contents with fortune telli ng prediction (Fig.7). An incense of grapefruit was found to be the most acceptable to the subjects at the feedback.  These results indicated that the HMI system was effective in inducing safe driving.

Nine senior drivers participated in the experiment. Their ages ranged from 69 to 80 years old and the average of their ages was 72 years old. The HMI system was modified as follows: 1) The contents of voice announcements were made shorter and simple, 2) Feed-forward was set to act 70m before intersections, 3) The incense of grapefruit was selected for the feedback. The specification of the modified HMI system was as follows. 1) At engine starting: voice greeting to encourage safe driving (8 seconds). The greeting and instruction are ¡°Hello, please enjoy safe driving.¡± 2) Feed-forward: voice announcement and *signal sound to notify drivers when approaching an intersection (70m before intersections). The announcement is   *signal sound, ¡°You are approaching an intersection.¡± 3) Feedback: *melody, incense of grape fruit and a voice message to give feedback information only when drivers stop safely at the intersection (just after passing through an intersection). The announcement is   *melody, ¡°Thank you for your safe stop.¡± 4) After-drive: a voice message to give feedback information of safe driving. The message is   ¡°Now, you have finished driving. Thank you for your safe driving.¡± 35455565758595Pre-driveannounceFFannounceFBannounceMelody After-driveannounceMean value of inductivity  scoreFigure 7 Score of inductivity 8  We examined the influence of driv ers¡¯ subjective evaluation on the ef fect of the HMI by analyzing the data of the questionnaire with the Cluster analysis. The Ward method and the Euclidean distance were used. An analysis was performed for both data of the female drivers and the senior drivers.   EVALUATION After experiments, an evaluation analysis using a questionnaire was conducted to examine the acceptability of the HMI sy stem among the subjects and its effects on safe driving. The analysis was conducted with deviding the question items into 2 groups. T able 1 shows an example of the question items. The questionnaire has 28 questions. Table 1 Two question items in the questionnaire  Qu estion items Answer Acceptability What kind of impression do you have for the voice messages? 1. Feel angry 2. Feel antipathy 3. No problem 4. Feel better Inductive Effect Does the voice message motivate you to drive safely? 1. Not at all 2. Not so much 3. To some extend 4. Very much Each question was given a score between 25 and 100 according t o a number assigned to an answer shown in Table 1 (1=25, 2=50, 3=75, and 4=100). A qualifying score was set to 75  point, which was assumed to be equivalent to the answer meaning ¡°no emotional problem¡± or ¡°a certain amount of effect¡±.  RESULT EFFECT AND EVALUATION OF THE HMI Figure 8 shows the mean value of TTI at the time of lifting foot off the acceleration pedal and that of TTI at the time of putting foot on the brake. Figure 9 shows the mean value of the angles of accelerator pedal when running through intersections. TTI at the time of lifting foot off the gas pedal increased by 40.0% with the modified HMI system (P<0.01) and TTI at the time of putting foo t o n t he brak e pedal also  significan tly decrea sed (P< 0.05) with the modified HMI system. These results showed that the HMI system was effective not only on notifying drivers who were approaching intersections early enough to slow down the vehicle speed, bu t also on ind ucing safe stopping at intersections. The re sults indicated  that th e subjects had changed their driving behavior to be more careful with the HMI system.  9  The data from the questionnaire investigation were analyzed by compare it with  qualifying points. We set qualifying point to ¡®75¡¯, which was gi ven to answers for the questionnaire, assuming that the modified HMI system was acting at permissible levels. Figure 10 and 1 1 show that t he modified HMI sy stem leads to satisf actory results in terms of both th e acceptability and th e inductive ef fect. Ther e was no chang e in the evaluation of the  announcement of F eed-forward which was not modified. In contrast, the evaluation of the announcement of both feedback and after-drive was promoted. These results suggested that the effect of the HMI was promoted by modification of the contents.

As a result, the female drivers were classified into two clusters (Fig. 12). One of the clusters can be recognized as a group who evaluated the HMI highly and the other can be recognized as one who devaluated it.     The senior drivers were also devided into two groups in the same way as the female drivers (Fig. 13).                    Figure 12 Dendrogram of female drivers  Figure13 Dendrogram of senior drivers  12  The two cluster groups were co mparatively analyzed the change of their driving behavior with the HMI system for both the female drivers and the senior drivers (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). The analysis showed that there was no si gnificant difference between two groups of the female drivers. On the contrary, it w as shown that the driving behavior of the seni or drivers were changed more significantly in the group who evaluated the HMI system highly than in those who evaluated th e system lower. For the s enior drivers, th e analysis results indicated that drivers¡¯ subjective evaluation influenced on the effect of the HMI system. The comparison of cluster ranges between the female drivers and the senior drivers suggested that subjective evaluation influenced on the effect of the HMI system when the evaluation score w as l ess than 60. In other words, the HM I system achieved the bes t ef fect if the subjective evaluation score became more than 60. The analysis of the cluster ranges indicates that 75 point set up as the qualifying point in this study was appropriate.     40506070809010011040 50 60 70 80 90 100 110Mean value of inductivity ratingMean value of acceptability rating40506070809010011040 50 60 70 80 90 100 110Mean value ofInductivity ratingMean value of Acceptability ratingThe effect of the HMI system is different between two cluster groups.

The results showed that the HMI system was effective not only on notifying drivers who are approaching intersections early enough to slow down the vehicle speed, but also on inducing safe stopping at intersections. The results have also indicated that the senior drivers had driven without any problems with the modified HMI system. Furthermore, the voice message to give feedback information for safe stopping was proven to induce a favorable feeling. In addition, the results indicated a possible effect for inducing continuous spontaneous safe stops.  An additional analysis was conducted to examine the relation between experimental data and the questionnaire data as well as differences in sex. The results indicated that the HMI achieve d the best effect when drivers¡¯ subjective evaluation reached a certain level.  FUTURE STUDY The HMI system designed in this study is a part of a safety driving support system that we are planning to develop. The entire system consists of two parts ¨C system A): a support system for ongoing driving, and system B): a support system for reviewing past driving records. System A is designed to promote awareness of surroundi ng hazard and to induce spontaneous safe driving. System B is a service system for drivers using System A and is designed to evaluate safety degree of their past driving records and to encourage them to continue safe driving.  In our next studies, we will conduct experiments using a real car on actual roads to verify the data obtained in t his study. Further, we will develop an HMI system to support dri ving not only at intersections but also in variety of traffic situations. A reviews system also needs to be built. W ith the se systems, sen ior drive rs c an i mprove risk m anagement and  hazard anticipation, and they can continue to drive safely.

Meanwhile, simulating experiment is necessary to validate reliability and security of the automatic platooning. In our research group, an experimental platform was realized by integrating TruckSim software and control algorithm of the automatic platooning into a driving simulator system. By the experimental platform, on the assumption of system failure and an emergent deceleration of preceding truck without warning, driver behaviors for the emergency avoidance of following truck were studied. Especially, brake operations were analyzed in the different mean maximum decelerations of the following truck. The results validated that the emergent avoidance readily accomplishes when the mean maximum deceleration of the following truck is higher than the setting of the preceding truck.  KEYWORDS Automatic Platooning, Driver Behaviors, Emergency Avoidance   INTRODUCTION Nowadays, automatic platooning is developing as a part of energy-saving techniques project in Japan. The technique of automatic platooning is used to keep closed gap distance of multiple trucks in the highway. To reduce the air resistance through the cloased gap distance, it is expected to achieve low fuel consumption and high traffic density (1). However, the security of the automatic platooning becomes one of the most importance problems for the practical application. Thereby, the safety should be discussed even for abnormal conditions of the automatic platooning, which can be reproduced and evaluated by using a driving simulator system. In the mixed traffic environments, other cars may wedge into the front of the cars¡¯ line, and it always accompanies some kinds of emergent decelerations. In this condition, it is necessary that manual operations are used to avoid collision during the automatic platooning in the closed gap distance of trucks (2) - (4). For the emergent avoidance, it is considered that the baking full-force of the following truck should be set higher than the proceeding truck. However, the level of the braking full-force need to be discussed through the driver¡¯s reaction to accomplish the safely emergent avoidance.   In the paper, the simulating experiments of the automatic platooning are introduced with a driving simulator, and then driver¡¯s behaviors for emergent avoidance are presented. -3-  The mean maximum deceleration of the preceding truck is set for 5.88 m/s2 (0.6 G), in the change of the mean maximum decelerations of the following trucks for 5.88 m/s2 (0.6 G), 6.37 m/s2 (0.65 G), and 6.86 m/s2 (0.7 G), the gap distance of trucks are measured and driver¡¯s behaviors are analyzed after the full-force braking test for the emergent stop experiments. Finally, the advantageous conditions of mean maximum decelerations are discussed for the successful rear-end collision avoidance.  EXPERIMENTAL STUDY SIMULATING AUTOMATIC PLATOONING To evaluate the safety of automatic platooning of trucks, dirver¡¯s behaviors for an emergent avoidance should be investigated through a full braking test. However, the full braking test will be at high risk for the actual-truck experiment of the automatic platooning, a driving simulator takes advantage of safely realizing the full braking test in a virtual traffic environment. In this study, the simulation experiment was acheived for the automatic platooning of trucks by integrating of controlling algorithm of automatic platooning and TruckSim software of truck dynamic into a universal driving simulator system (5-6). The driving simulator (DS) is shown in Figure 1. The preceding truck achieves 80 km/h (22.22 m/s) for 70 seconds on the main road, and driver rides in the following truck to pursue the preceding truck. After a certain time, the following truck and the preceding truck are similarly driving in the velocity of 80 km/h, and 10 meters gap distances of the two trucks are keeping automatically. The following truck is reproduced by the DS, and the motion of the preceding truck is displayed in the surrounding screens of the DS. After the automatic platooning is formed, and driver only seats in the following truck and don¡¯t operate the truck any more. However, when the preceding truck make an emergent stop without warning in advance, the driving mode of the following truck transfers to manual drving mode from the automatic platooning in the same time. The driver in the following truck confirms the tail-lamp of the ptrceding truck and adopts a full-force braking operation to avoid rear-end collsion to the preceding truck.              Figure 1. Driving Simulator. -4-  EMERGENT AVOIDANCE EXPERIMENTS In the different experiments, the mean maximum decelerations of the following trucks were set on 5.88 m/s2 (0.6 G), 6.37 m/s2 (0.65G), and 6.86 m/s2 (0.7G), respectively, but the mean maximum deceleration of the preceding truck was always set on 0.6 G. As a preliminary experiment, subject drive the following truck and tries to keep 10 meters gap distance to the preceding trucks, and the mean maximum deceleration of the two trucks is 5.88 m/s2. Then, subject in the following truck manually makes a full-force braking, when an emergent stop of the preceding truck automatically occurs without warning in advance.  For the mean maximum decelerations of the following truck of 0.6 G, 0.65 G, and 0.7 G, the driving experiemnt were excecuted for two times, respectively. In the experiment, steering operation of the DS was fixed and didn`t studied, since rear-end collision avoidance mainly results from the braking operations. The positions of the emergent stop changes for the different experiments, so that the subject cann¡¯t forecast the timing point of the emergent stop in advance.  EMERGENT AVOIDANCE   Figure 2. Flow of Braking Operations.  As is shown in Figure 2, braking and time indices are defined based on the flow of the emergent stop (8, 9). The driver reaction time is from the lighting time of tail-lamp to -5-  the beginning of brake pedal operation. Brake response time is the beginning of brake pedal operation to the time of the mean maximum deceleration by the full-force braking. The mean maximum deceleration time is from the beginning to the end of the mean maximum deceleration. By the way, stopping gap distance is the distance after the two trucks stopped.         10 males from 20s to 60s are cooprated with the driving experiments. The subject image is shown in Figure 3. The ages, driving experiments, and driving frequency are presented in Table 1. Before the experiemtns, the agreements were signed with every subject on the basis of a sufficient explaination of the experimental contents to the subject.  Table 1. Characters of Subject. Item Age (Years) Driving Experience (Years) Driving Frequency (Times/Month) Mean 31 9.5 7.8 S.D. 11.5 8.8 7.9 RESULTS AND DISCUSIONS DRIVING PARAMETERS The gap distance of trucks during the whole experiment is presented in Figure 4. It is shown that the following truck automatically purpues the preceding truck for about 75 seconds, and the automatic platooning is formed while 10 meters gap distance of the trucks is keeping. Then, the gap distance abruptly droped becaue of the emergent stop of the trucks.  On the basis of one subject¡¯s experimental data in the different experiments, the velocities of the following trucks and the preceding truc are shown in Figure 5. The time is for 8 seconds before and after of the emergent decelerations, and the velocities of the following trucks and the preceding truck decreased from 22.2 m/s to 0 m/s. Even though the beginning times took place in the different experiments dependent on the reaction times of the subject, there are few difference for the beginning times of the following trucks. When the mean maximum decelerations are 0.6 G for the trucks, the difference of the stopping time is similar with the difference of the beginning time. However, when the mean maximum deceleration is 0.65 G for the following truck, the stopping times of the following truck and the preceding truck are almost similar. When the mean  Figure 3. Subject Image. -6-  maximum deceleration of the following truck is 0.7 G, the stopping time of the following truck is earlier than the preceding truck. In other words, the braking distance is shortened for the following truck. The accelerations of the preceding truck and the following truck for one subject¡¯s experimental data are presented in the Figure 6. It is clear that the maximum deceleration achieve earlier and the mean maximum deceleration times also becomce shorter, when the mean maximum decelerations of the following trucks are higher.

Velocities of the Preceding Truck and the Following Trucks with the Different Mean Maximum Decelerations.  Figure 6. Accelerations of the Preceding Truck and the Following Trucks. -7-  AVOIDANCE BIHAVIORS ANALYSIS After the full braking test during the automatic platooning, the results are concluded. The results of gap distances of the trucks after emergent stop, driver reaction times, brake response times, and the mean maximum deceleration times are presented in Figures 7-10, respectively. The results are demonstrated by mean values and standard deviations for 10 subjects.  In Figure 7, it is shown that the gap distances of the trucks after emergent stop is significantly different for the different mean maximum decelerations of the following trucks. The gap distance is minus values while the mean maximum deceleration is 0.6G, which means the rear-end collision occurred between the trucks. By contraries, the emergent avoidance successfully accomplished when the mean maximum decelerations of the following trucks are higher than 0.6 G. Certainly, the mean maximum decelerations of the preceding truck is 0.6 G for every experiment.  In Figure 8, all of the reaction time of driver is arount 0.57 seconds, even though the reaction times of driver increase a little in the conditions of 0.65 G and 0.70 G. The differences between the reaction times in the different conditions are not significant by the results of T-test analysis at significant level 5%.  In Figures 9 and 10, the brake response time and the mean maximum deceleration time apparently decreased with the increase of the mean maximum deceleration, because the physical performace of the brakes are improved. At the significant level 5%, the differences of the different brake response times and of the mean maximum deceleration times are significantly different by the results of T-test analysis.

For the instances, the results of gap distance after emergent stop, reaction time of driver, response time of brake, and mean maximum deceleration time are shown in Figures 11 ~ 14, respectively.  When the mean maximum deceleration of the following truck and preceding truck is 0.6G, rear-end cllision for 75% of the total experiment happened, and the mean gap distance after emergent stop is -2.5 meters. For the other 25% of the total experiment, the rear-end collision were successfully avoided, but the gap distances after are less than 0.5 meters after the emergent stop. The differences of the response time of brake and mean maximum deceleration time are very few, but difference of reaction time of driver is about 0.12 seconds between the crashed condition and the uncrashed condition. It is considered the main reason to result in the rear-end collision.  Figure 11. Gap Distances of trucks after Emergent Stop in the Crashed and Uncreahsed Conditions (Mean ¡À S.D.).  Figure 12.

QUESTIONNARE INVESTIGATION  When the mean maximum decelerations of the preceding truck are 0.6G, 0.65G, and 0.7G, respectively, but the mean maximum deceleration of the following truck is always 0.6G, the driving experiemnt were excecuted two times for each condition. After every experiment, questionnaire was done by subject about sense of fear to the emergent avoidance. On the whole, the distinctions of the questionnaires¡¯ results are obvious for the different conditions. When the mean maximum deceleration is 0.6 G, subjects felt much and more sense of fear to rear-end collision. When the mean maximum deceleration is 0.65 G, normal and few of sense of fear were responded by many subjects. When the mean maximum deceleration is 0.7 G for the following truck, many subjects felt relatively safe. By the questionnaire investigation, it is shown that the sense of fear is relatively few, when the mean maximum deceleration of the following truck is higher the preceding truck. 00.30.60.9Crashed UncrashedBrake Response Times (s)00.511.522.533.5Crashed UncrashedMaximum Deceleration Times  (s) -11-   Figure 15. Questionnaire Results for Sense of Fear in the Mean Maximum Decelerations of the Following Trucks of 0.6G, 0.65G, and 0.7G.  CONCLUSIONS The automatic platooning of trucks is successful reproduced by using a universal driving simulator. The following truck and the preceding truck are driving on 80 km/h, and 10 meters gap distances of the trucks are being kept during the automatic platooning. Driver in the following truck makes the maximum pedal effort or full-force braking to avoid rear-end collsion, while the proceeding truck take place an emergent deceleration without warning. On the basis of the simulating experimens, driver behaviors were evaluated through the analysis of gap distance after stopping, driver reaction time, brake response time, and mean maximum deceleration time.  There is a great possibility of rear-end collsion, when the following truck hold same capability of mean maximum deceleration 0.6G with the preceding trucks. However, it is readily realized to avoid rear-end collision dependent on driver¡¯s full-force braking operations, when the following truck hold the capability of the mean maximum deceleration 0.65G and 0.7G that is higher than the mean maximum deceleration of the 0.6G0.65G0.7G0123456Votes-12-  following truck 0.6G. Moreover, drivers felt few sense of fear to the emergent avoidance of the rear-end collision, when the mean maximum deceleration of the following truck is higher than the preceding trucks.

They also are a group, whose risks seem to be very difficult to reduce. This paper describes a unique field trial on a feedback system that has a potential of great safety benefits for novice drivers. With a GPS installed in the novice drivers¡¯ car, we periodically produced feedback that motivated the novice in safe driving and helped them comparing their driving with others. There are clear indications, that a well prepared feedback helps the novice drivers in paying attention to the shortcomings of the inexperienced drivers. And the feedback seems to affect the driving style, especially if there is also some external person receiving the feedback. The test users of the feedback, novice drivers and their parents have been interested in the feedback and see it as a potential measure in enhancing learning and improving traffic safety.   INTRODUCTION  In Finland, novice car drivers are over-represented in the road accident statistics. It takes several years before the novice drivers reach the average drivers¡¯ risk level. Novice drivers have to practice driving independently in real traffic, even though it is known to be the riskiest period in their driver career. (1)  Novice drivers still living with their parents use often car which is owned by their parents. Therefore, parents of a novice driver have a strong motivation to follow the driving behaviour and po ssible acc ident risk o f a novice driver when young driver starts the independent driving. Above mentioned issues motivated to setup t he T ele-ISA field t rial o f driving behaviour feedback for novice drivers and their p arents. Periodical feedback was given e.g. about how risky the driving was based on the inf ormation about used speeds on d ifferent speed limits (2). Respective earlier studies indicated that giving feedback on driving style has a positive effect on reducing speeding (3).    2FIELD TRIAL SETUP  The recruitment for Tele-ISA field trial was started in late spring 2010. In order to reach novice drivers and their parents, several approaches were utilised: including advertisements in news papers, local ve hicle inspection offices and o fficial slippery c onditions t raining tracks, where young drivers need to visit before getting their driving permit. Furthermore, direct email advertisements were circulated within co-operating organisations. In general, young drivers were difficult to recruit into a research s tudy in which their driving style is monitored. But adequate number of participants was obtained w ith in some cases little pressure from the parents, who were in general more interested about the study. Active participation to t he study was supported with a m onthly draw, in which a s mall voucher (¡þ150) was the main prize. To qualify for the lottery, the car had to be in active use, novice driver had to use the provided key to recognize the driver and even answers to the three feedback questionnaires were required.   In summer 2010, around 30 novice drivers with their parents started the six month field trial. The research participation contract was signed by both owner of the car and the novice driver. The number of female and male novice drivers was equal and most of the novice drivers were between 18¨C20 years. Most of the installed vehicles were o wned by the parents, but so me were owned by the novice drivers. A reference group was built up from young drivers who owned their car and did not get any feedback about their driving style and another one with drivers participating TeleFOT project (field operational test on using mobile phone services, see: www.telefot.eu).    The field t rial was do ne in co -operation wi th P PCT Finland Ltd, which pro vides fleet management and automatic driver¡¯s log services for various companies. For Tele-ISA PPCT provided t he vehicle installations, dat a collection from vehicles a nd as a reward for t he participants PPCT provided their automatic driver¡¯s log service for free.    DATA ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING  Data acquisition from vehicles was implemented with GPS/GPRS loggers which collected information about driving and the driver¡¯s identity. The loggers were installed out of sight by electricians and drew power e.g. from interior lights.  In order to identify the driver of the vehicle, the novice drivers used an RFID button when driving and other drivers did not use a button. No other activity or activation by the driver was required for the logging.  The loggers recorded GPS data (pos ition, speed, heading) with variable sa mpling r ate (average 4.5 times a minute). They also detected and sent event data (harsh braking, hard cornering, hard acceleration etc.) processed internally from 1 Hz GPS measurements.  Data post-processing and analysis for feedback reporting was done by VTT. The process included map matching, comparison against digital speed limit database from the Finnish Transport Agency (D igiroad), and driving behaviour indicator calculation for feedback reports.      3The calculations included plausibility checking of the data: in some cases, loggers recorded movement due to GPS errors even when parked in a garage. Some of the highest recorded speeds were also considered to be errors after comparing the speed to movement in coordinates.  Approximately 200 derived variables were calculated from GPS data for each trip, including total distance travelled, percentage driven on roads w ith certain speed limit, times of hard braking, percentage of night driving, percentage driven in ur ban areas et c. A few of these derived variables were chosen for the feedback reporting.  Clear speeding cases were detected and listed separately, requiring at least 2 consecutive samples and a minimum distance of 200 meters of speeding. A map image was generated from these cases for each driver, showing the locations and details for each case.   FEEDBACK ON DRIVING BEHAVIOUR  In Tele-ISA field trial driving behaviour feedback was always given in two week periods. Real t ime feedback was not used because we wanted to concentrate o n more general feedback, strategic decisions rather than tactical or operational. Thus we did not have to include any in-vehicle device with HMI. And the analysis of the collected data enabled better map matching and filtering of possible errors in the speed limit database, than what can be done in real time.   First, there was one month (before) data acquisition period when no feedback was given. This data was utilised as reference later in the feedback reports. After this, the driving behaviour feedback reports were sent via email to respective novice driver as well as to the owner of the car, often a parent, twice a month.       The driving behaviour feedback was developed during the Tele-ISA project. Three different feedback reports were used in the project with following content: 1. kilometres, speeds, dr iving during dark hours, driving during rush hour, number of hard accelerations, decelerations and hard cornering 2. (in addition to previous) amount of speeding and risk index describing higher risk  to get involved into a fatal accident due to speeding  3. (in addition to previous) a map on most severe speeding cases wa s displayed over Google Maps (including date, time, maximum speed, speed limit, distance of  continual speeding).  These parameters were presented in the report for both novice driver (identified by ID button) and other drivers of the vehicle. As a reference, the report also included average values the reported parameters calculated from the whole test group data collected during the same period.  To give an option for a quick overview, a grading was done by comparing results with the data collected during the reference period: the most critical parameters, risk index and hard cornering, were highlighted with colours red, yellow and green. The upper quartile got a red colour and the lower quartile a green colour ¨C and all the rest a yellow one (Table 1).    4  Driver Study group averages [events / 100 km] [events / 100 km] Accelerations > 0.25 g / 100 km 4.5 4.8 Use of brake / 100 km 118 88 Strong braking (> 0.25 g) / 100 km 19.2 11.2 Very hard braking (> 0.5 g) / 100 km 3.2 3.2 Strong cornering force (> 0.45 g) / 100 km 7.2 7.2  Table 1. A partial report example about accelerations, summer-time data   DATA USED IN THE ANALYSIS  During the second half of 2010 data was collected from all the drives of around 30 vehicles. All these cars were used by at least one novice driver, but most of them had other users as well. The t otal data consists around 270 000 vehicle kilometres, on an a verage 1330 km/month/car. This is quite near the average for all the cars in Finland.   As described earlier, the actual speed limit for every speed observation was received based on GPS and a digital speed map. The speed limit could be found from the Digiroad reliably for around 80 % of the observations. Most of the remaining speed limits are 80 km/h or 50 km/, which in Finland are t he general limits on rural and urban areas, if not signed otherwise. Those observations were excluded from the analysis. This decision was based on two points: these speed limits would probably have more errors than the signed speed limits. Additionally these rural roads are of a different kind of nature: often they are gravel roads, which cannot even be driven with a speed of 80 km/h.   Some of the cars were used by more than one novice driver. So we had totally 34 novice drivers included. Six of the cars were owned by the novice drivers, but all the other cars had a separate owner ¨C they were typically owned by the parents of the novice drivers. In these cases the feedback was given also to the owners of the cars.   All the novice drivers and the owners of the cars got request to reply on three Internet surveys on the experience on the feedback. Questionnaires were sent at even intervals, so we got information about opinions and their progress during the study.    RESULTS  This paper presents the first findings of the analysis. Unfortunately the analysis is not yet finalized, because there has been some delay in receiving the data from the two comparison groups: young car drivers, who did not receive feedback on their driving style and car drivers in the TeleFOT field study.     5DRIVING SPEEDS AND RISKS  At the beginning of the field study, there was a period, when the dr ivers did not get any feedback from their driving (around one month in June). This period is used as a reference material. All the reporting periods and contents of the data to be collected and reported were informed clearly in advance to all participants.  We compared the driving styles and opinions of three groups in the test user population: i) novice drivers using family cars, ii) novice drivers, who owned their car and iii) other users (often owners, i.e. parents) of the family cars.  Already during the reference period most of the drivers seemed to obey the speed limits exceptionally well (Table 2) compared to speeds in earlier studies (2, 3). Novice drivers, who owned their car (no reporting to anyone else), did not obey the speed limits quite as well as the other drivers.

They both got feedback from their own drives and the drives of the other users of the same car.  Table 2. Distribution of kilometres (%) by the amount of speeding and total number of kilometres during the reference period (=100%).  The test users wanted easy summary information as a p art of the feedback. E.g. the data as presented in Table 2 was considered as too complicated and hard to figure out. So we tried to develop a reliable, easy and understandable way of weighting together different kinds o f speeding on different speed limits, e.g. frequent small speeding in rural area co mpared to more rare but harder speeding in urban area.      It has been proposed by G?ran Nilsson, that the risk to be involved in an injur y accident is changed proportional to the second power and the risk to be involved in a fatal accident is changed proportional to the fourth power of speed change (figure 1). The relationship has been studied for changes of speeds of traffic flows but we used it to calculate relative risks for individual drivers in different conditions (2, 4). Using the curves in Figure 1 for each individual speed observation, we calculated relative risks to summarise how well the speed limits were obeyed (Table 3). So the drivers were told how much their risk of being involved in a fatal accident was increased because o f s peeding. This in formation wa s g iven for different speed limits, so drivers could figure out, where they tend to speed up.      6  Figure 1. Relative risk for a fatal accident by speed and speed limit.

A partial report example about increased risk, summer-time data  During the reference period there were only small differences in the risk increase due to speeding between the groups (Figure 2). The first type of feedback (R1¨CR3) was o nly on mileage, accelerations and speed without comparing to speed limits. During these periods the novice drivers seemed to increase their speeding. But the other type of feedback seemed to slow down them, especially those who drove family cars. This is an indication, that feedback to the parents of the novice drivers had a positive effect on traffic sa fety by decreasing speeding. The third type of feedback was given during the winter period only. Especially they need to be studied further together with the speed variation of comparison groups.    7 1) R1= type 1 report three times (kilometres, used speeds and acceleratrions) R2= type 2 report three times (also speeding and risk increase) NoFB= No feedback ¨Cperiod R3, W= type 3 report three time (also speeding maps, W= lower winter time speed limits) Figure 2. Progress of risk due to speeding by test periods (July-December 2010).  We also found some indications that the driving style of parents can affect the driving style of the novice driver, but this needs to be studied in more detail.   OPINIONS ON FEEDBACK SYSTEM  Especially the owners but also the novice drivers supported the idea of giving feedback to the novice driver and even building up a system to g ive feedback to drivers for independent driving before they acquire their permanent driving license. Along with the study, opinions on giving feedback got even more positive.   During the study the feedback was developed so, that more overall descriptive statistics and general ratings were given at the end of the study. This was supported by the test persons, because they felt that too detailed information confused them. Also showing worst speeding cases on a map got good feedback.  The feedback was told to be used for comparing driving styles with the other persons using the same car, with the own results before and during the reference period as well as with the result of other cars in the st udy. The t hree types o f feedback co nsidered as most useful (Figure 3) were: information on speeding (as table 2), risk increase due to speeding (as table 3) and map on the most severe speeding cases by each driver (as Figure 4). In general, owners of the cars were even more interested in feedback on speeding: how much and where as well as how much it affected risks.   8  Figure 3. Opinions on feedback for speeding, risk increase and speeding maps by novice drivers (N=19) and other owners of the cars (N=16).   Figure 4. A partial report example on speeding map (date, time, speed limit, maximum speed and length of each speeding by at least 10 km/h presented on an interactive map).     9CONCLUSIONS  Tele-ISA project has setup a u nique field trial on a feedback system that seems to have a potential of great safety benefits for novice drivers - a n especially risky car dr iver group. Preliminary analyses show promising outcome.   Using standard equipment we developed a set of feedback that was considered to be useful. There are also strong indications, that the feedback enhances safety, especially when it will be given also to someone who is interested in novice driver¡¯s safety ¨C in this case parent.       Feedback will be further developed in the next project together with driver learning experts.  The idea of giving feedback to the novice driver was well supported by the novice drivers and especially their pare nts. Feedback should be further developed as a par t of driver learning process ¨C this was supported also by the test persons, both novice drivers and their parents.    All the equipment needed for these kinds of services will be shortly available at all cars with minimal costs. So, the next obvious steps to prepare for the full scale use are  - developing further the feedback (underway) - large scale studies to refine safety effect estimates - considerations on legislation and prerequisites for these kind of services and  - a market study.

 1DIFFERENTIATING SKILLED AND UNSKILLED DRIVERS BY USING AN ADABOOST CLASSIFIER FOR DRIVER'S OPERATIONS  Shuguang Li*, Daisuke Yamaguchi*, Yoichi Sato*, Yoshihiro Suda*,Takayuki Hirasawa*, *Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8505 Japan lsg04, ymagiis, ysato, suda, hirasawa@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp  Shojiro Takeuchi** and Satomi Yoshioka** **Toyota Motor Corporation 3-3-5, Higashi-Ikebukuro, Toshima-ku, Tokyo, 170-8405 Japan shojiro@takeuchi.tec.toyota.co.jp ABSTRACT Prior to develop ing driving assistance systems to i mprove dri ving skills, the dif ferences between skilled and unskilled drivers must be clarified. Previous studies suggest that highly skilled drivers share certain characteristics in accelerator, brake, and steering operations. This paper propo ses a statistical method to ex tract these characteristics fro m data o btained in  driving simulator experiments of driving around curves. The proposed method is composed of wavelet transform and an AdaBoost algorithm, a machine learning algorithm.  INTRODUCTION Drivers' skills determine how safely he/she drives, how much fuel he/she consumes, and even how comfortable he/she is while driving. A cross-cultural comparison of drivers' skills shows that drivers share a common tendency to overestimate of their own skills [1]. This phenomenon suggests that the benefits derived from driving practice may be reduced by more risky driving behavior. Thus, it  would be beneficial if there were a dr iving-skill estimation method to determine whether drivers' b ehavior is desirable or not . Moreover, some researchers have proposed methods to decide whether someone¡¯s driving is smooth enough and then provides necessary advice if it is  not[2]. How ever, th ese methods still remain to b e qu alitatively analyzed [3]. To advise unskilled drivers effectively, we have developed a quantitative method to distinguish between the skilled and unskilled groups. It detects w hat the best features and corresponding thresholds are to distinguish between the two groups. The first problem is how to define the skilled and unskilled groups. The jerk, which is the time differential of acceleration, is widely applied to analyze driving behavior. While the acceleration describes how a driver speeds up and slows down, the jerk shows how a driver accelerates and decelerates, which is more important in determining the driver's operation characteristic. Some researches have shown that less fuel is consumed and safety is improved if a driver can drive more smoothly [2] [4].Those authors suggested the less smooth driver tended to generate relatively high jerks in almost the same conditions. Some researchers even  2Fig. 2 Experiment Scenario  introduce this theory to new con trol strategies to improve ride comfort [5]. Many researchers have suggested that the jerk is an important factor that illuminates driver¡¯s skill.  Therefore, in this paper, the skilled and unskilled groups are separated by integration of jerk composed by the lateral/longitude jerks. In pr inciple, a skilled driver should driv e around a curve smoothly, which corresponds to smaller integrated jerk value. To make sure of the comparability, the lateral/longitude jerk is normalized by distance. We rank all trials based on the sum of composed jerk along th e course from small to large, and then, classify the to p about 1/3 laps as the skilled groups while the low about 1/3 laps as unskilled.  It is important to no te that classification based on jerk does not provide us an insight on what kind of driving behaviors are critical for improving driving skills. Toward this goal, we take the approach to make clear the difference between the skilled and unskilled drivers' behaviors by preparing thousands of candidate features and then extract a few representative features. Since the d riving b ehaviors are d ynamic, we  deco mpose the vel ocity, st eering angle, steering speed, accelerator position, and brake pedal data by wavelet transform to analyze the periodic character. On the basis of decomposed results, sub-windows are added to determine the amount of cand idate f eatures and th en i nput in to AdaBoos t algo rithm to det ect the characteristics. We arrange the following sections along the flow chart shown in Fig. 1. At the end of the paper, the experiment results are described.   NORMALIZATION Original data recorded in experi ments usually array in time history. As the  velocity varies, drivers finished the lap in different times, so it is difficult to compare data among different laps. To compare the drivers' behaviors at the same place, the lateral/longitude jerk, velocity, steer angle, steering speed, accelerator position, and brake pedal data are normalized by 0.3-m distances. The formula expressions used for normalization as follows.

C is th e normalization point located between the points A and B. It is must noticed that point A/B is the closest sample to point C, which means there are no other samples located between point A and C or point B and C. We take longitude acceleration as an example. Here, Aa  and Ba  are the acceler ation of poi nt A  and B. ca  is th e nor malization acceleration for p oint C. In the expression of C¡þ , 0.00 5-rad denote s the central angle increment. Since the radius of the curves is 60-m, the increment 0.005-rad is corresponding to a 0.3-m distance increment. For each N, th ere is only one corresponding poin t C. With the increase of N, all the date would be normalized along the curve. Similarly, during the straight road, variables are standardized by simple linear interpolation. In Fig. 3(b) shows the data normalization during the straight road. Here also take longitude acceleration as example.  In for mula.3,  ),( ii YX   i s t he coord inates that indicate th e location poin ts.

This makes it possible to compare different drivers¡¯ operations at the same place. ...,,arctan  ii i CBAiXY¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ,2,1005.0)( ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ NNaaaa CAACABABc ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þFig.4  Sub-window  and Feature BAC¡þ,2,13.0)( ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ NNXaXXXXaaa CAACABABc(1) (2) (3) (b) Straight Road (a) Curve AB C  Point A¡¢B¡¢C corresponding angleCBA ¡þ¡þ¡þFig.3 Data NormalizationSection Section  4Fig. 6 Steer Angle vs. Time WAVELET TRANSFORM In order to examine driving behaviors, it is important to analyze their dynamics. Therefore, periodic characters must be analyzed. In addition, driving characteristics may be clearly seen when a small oscillation occurs for a short moment which is beyond the Fourier Analysis. As shown in F ig. 6, when a driver was driving through a curve, continuous corrective action happened at the exit  of a c urve. Moreover , in principle, such oscil lation may be a characteristic of an unskilled driver. To detect the b arely visib le ch aracteristics of  drivers¡¯ b ehavior, wav elet transform  is inducted to deco mpose th e data into dif ferent frequency co mponents. The sim plest wavelet-Haar function is use d as a mother w avelet to deco mpose and recode the approximation or each level in detail. Figure 7 shows the wavelet decomposition tree for the above-mentioned signals. For example, in the first decomposition process, the original data is decomposed into cA1 and cD1 subset. And the detail coefficients cD1 are small and consist mainly of a high-frequency noise, while the approximation coefficients cA1 contain much less noise than does the original signal. And the character of oscillation in Fig. 6 is expected to appear among 'the high-frequency noise' in cD1. The decomposition process can be iterated, with successive approximations being decomposed in turn, so that one signal is broken down into many lower resolution components. The output data after adopting wavelet-Haar function in 3 steps are cA3, cD1,cD2 and cD3 (In Fig.7). Therefore, the characters such as oscillation in Fig. 6 are expected to appear among cD1~cD3. Because the first level of the wav elet decomposed data, denoted as cA3 in the decomposition tree, just eliminates the main from the original data with much less noise, it keeps almost the same profile as the original data.  Fig. 5 Data Before/After NormalizationFig. 7 Signal¡¯s Wavelet Decomposition Tree  5CANDIDATE FEATURES All driving operations happen in short moments, and some are even so tiny as to b e barely visible. Therefore, the candidate features must reflect the characteristics in an interval. Thus, we add windows in the decomposed data to determine candidate features. Here the following features are considered.  As shown in Fig. 4, the width of window is 30 sampling points, which corresponds to a real distance of 9 m. The feature is the sum of a variable in the latter half rectangle subtracted from the sum of the former half. The operation can be written as follows: In formula.4 iJ  is the variation name. Basically, it is supposed that a sk illed driver will drive smoothly. The corresponding operations should change slowly, so their features should be smaller. All the parameters of driving characteristics that are supposed to exist are used to generate candidate features after wavelet transform, such as velocity, brake pedal position, accelerator pedal operation, steering angle, and steering speed.  FEATURE EXTRACTION The learnin g algorit hm is bas ed on AdaBoost,  which selects a small nu mber of critical features a nd yields ex tremely efficient c lassifiers. The algorith m is widely  used in face detection research [6]. In this paper, drivers are divided into two groups: skilled and unskilled. (The sel ect crit erion is  introduce d late r). In accord ance with th e ab ove method, a  l arge number of c andidate features is prep ared as the input of the AdaBoost algorithm. This is expected to reveal some of th e most important differences between the two groups. This means that a combination of those extracted characteristics and the corresponding threshold quantity must be most able to separate the two groups. M oreover, those features must be given especial attention by unskilled drivers.   Furthermore, for each feature, the optimal threshold is determined such that the minimum numbers of e xamples are misclassified. In addition, al l t he features and thresholds are combined into a skilled/unskilled classifier function, which is called the strong classifier in AdaBoost theory and can be used to decide if one's driving is skilled or not.  DRIVING SIMULATOR A driving simulator equipped with 6-DOF motion platform and a turntable and interactive microscopic traf fic environment is  used in th e res earch. B y using its  eight s creens a nd projectors, drivers can have a 360-degree field-of-view. We can design the scenario necessary for experiment. Figure 8 is a photograph of the driving simulator. ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ301615 iiiiiii jjJ (4)  6Fig. 8 Driving Simulator EXPERIMENT In this p aper, th e attention is focused on dri ving s kills in curv e s ections. Th erefore, al l experiments are operated with the scenario and course shown in Fig. 2. The course is basically composed of two curves bot h wit h a 60- m ra dius. Elev en dr ivers participated i n th e experiment. To replicate real traffic conditions, they decided the speed at which they entered the curves and the steering/braking operations. The start/end points were also marked on the course. The drivers were given the following instructions before experiments. 1. Each driver drove around the course 11 times. After the first practice lap, the opinions of each driver were asked. If practice was s till needed, a d river could do at most three practice laps. 2. Basically, all operations were completely up to the driver. 3 The only condition was that each driver had to try his/her best to avoid veering off the road.   RESULT A total of 110 laps¡¯ worth of data was collected. To determine the skilled and unskilled sample groups, we introduce the parameter J, which is the integrated value of composed jerk.    ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þNiilongitudeilateral JJJ122                   £¨2£© is the i-th sam ple of s tandardized la teral or  In the equ ation, ilateralJ ¡þ or   longitude jerk.

In the figur e, also  9inserted is a rectangle that indicates where the feature appears. Data in the rectangle were used to create the right graph. Using the first level of the wavelet transfer results for data in the rectangular for each lap determines the features described above: the sum of the left part was subtracted from the sum of the right part. In both skilled and unskilled groups, we array the obtained characteristic value in the order from smallest to largest and pl ot them in the right graph. The straight line parallel to the x-axis indicates the threshold for th e feature. Graphs in (b) and (c) are produced in the same way.  Both the first and second features are speed-related and appeared at almost the same place near the end section of the  curve. Skilled drivers obtained results smaller than the threshold about features. Therefore, one of the most important characteristics is that skilled drivers changed speed slightly over the distance where the feature appeared. This means that at the exit section of the curve, unskilled drivers should have controlled the speed more smoothly. The third feature happens at the beginning of the straight road after the first curve. The threshold indicates that the skilled drivers tend to press down less on the accelerate pedal. In other words, unskilled drivers tend to accelerate more rapidly; skilled drivers operated the vehicle smoothly even when they decide to speed up at the beginning of the long straight road.  DISCUSSION In the paper, one of most important problem is defining skilled/unskilled driving. Depending on the focus, definitions will of course be vastly different. For a F1 driver, the one who can finish the lap in the shortest time is obviously skilled. Nevertheless, in everyday life, we usually focus on comfort, safety, and costs. From this perspective, the definition based on the composed jerk is easy to understand and accept. Certainly, this is just one definition among thousands. The proposed method could be used to detect the distinction between other groups on the basis of different definitions. In the experiments, each driver did 11 laps, and each lap was treated as if it were done by a different driver. As none of the drivers had driven around the course before this scenario, they gradually became familiar with the road conditions after a few laps, so their driving tended to become more skilled. This trend is also found in the experimental results, and it could be direct evidence of the effectiveness of the evaluation method.   At present, only three of the characteristics have been detected as significantly important features. This number is e xpected to inc rease a s the driven laps in the database beco me manifold. Since the basic idea is to find features to separate the two groups, if the number of similar features increases, the necessary features will also increase. The characteristics currently being identified are isolated; whether they are intrinsically linked still needs to be explored.  The velocity is one of the important factors affecting the jerk. In experiments, the speed totally depends on the driver. In the paper, the selected laps done by the skilled group tend to be relatively slow. However, too slow a speed often causes traffic jams and even dangerous traffic conditions, such as frequently overtakes by other vehicles. Therefore, the more complex traffic environments must be taken into consideration, for example, setting a leading vehicle.  10 All the mentioned problems will be considered in further research.  CONCLUSION In this research, w e have propose d a qu antitative assessment method for d riving behavior based on a mountain of driving data. Our three main conclusions are as follows:  1. On the basis of the AdaBoost algorithm, a quantitative evaluation method was proposed to extract the characteristics of the drive operations. 2. Experiments focused on how drivers' behaved while driving around curves were carried out using a driving simulator. A database was constructed with the collected data. 3. Based on the database obtained from step 2, the most important operation features for the skilled/unskilled groups were detected by the proposed method. Among a large number of features, one acceleration pedal -related operation at the beginning of straight road and two velocity-related features at the exit part of curve were detected as the most import differences between skilled and unskilled groups. The results show the proposed method is feasible.  In future researc h, detailed analysis and discussion should be conducted for operatio n features extracted by the proposed operation, such as the intrinsic link among features. Other challenges such as developing methods for generating candidate features and applying our method to a variety of driving situations will also be taken into consideration.  REFERENCE [1] M.

DETECTION OF STEERING DIRECTION FROM PARALLEL FACTOR ANALYSIS OF DRIVER'S EEG IN LANE CHANGE MANEUVER  Toshihito IKENISHI Takayoshi KAMADA and Masao NAGAI Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering, 2-24-26 Naka-machi, Koganei-shi, Tokyo- 184-8588, Japan +81-42-388-7094, ikenishi@cc.tuat.ac.jp  ABSTRACT Vehicle technology of the bette r interaction between human and m achine has been called human-electronics in Japan. It is necessary to  obtain better relationship between hum an and vehicle. A driver¡¯s inf ormation, which can  be obtained from  steering operation, pedal operation, camera images and physiological inf ormation, particularly is im portant to find a method to determ ine a driver¡¯s operational in tention. In term s of using this physiological information, an area of focus is using brain ac tivity. Recently, some former researches haves been reported about the investigation of the brain activity  of the driver.  In this p aper, we described that the driver¡¯s EEG during lane  change was decom posed by PARAFAC and we investigated the factor of recognize and judgment from that decomposition result.  INTRODUCTION The research reports of Brain-Com puter Interface (BCI) and Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) have been increased s ince las t decade. BCI  and BMI are being  research ed as  a new communication means for serious handicapped persons. As for those researches, what people communicate about user' s intention by using the PC is the m ain stream. There are use to a change in the EEG when a person m oves and images. These b rain activities occu r before human behaviour. Therefore, it is possible to us e that it is not only a handicapped person but also the healthy person as well. Recently, the research that the brain activities of the driver were analyzed has been reported in the field of the automotive. Technology of the better interaction between human and machine has been called hum an electronics in Japan. As it is essential to realize good cooperation between th e hum an and the m achine, human characteristics in u sing m achines are investigated and the machine will f it the hu man characteris tics in o rder to  get desirab le cooperative characteristics. At present, as for the use of the brain ac tivities in the vehicle research are the evaluation of the fatigue degree during the driving and the sleepiness, and the evaluation of the comfortableness in the vehicle, the evaluation of the vehicles design which is easy to recognize. Normal driving information flowAssistance system information flowNew information flowoperationjudgmentcognitionDriverVehicleThe driving assistance systemAssistThe driving assist ance system cooperate with driverInformationRoadenvironmentTrafficOperationMeasurementWarning/Assist Fig.1 Information flow of driving a vehicle with driving assist system. Information of the deriving has a traffic, road environment, vehicle behavior of driving and driver¡¯s operation. A driver¡¯s information particularly is important to find a driver¡¯s operational intention for driving assistance.  Then, the goal of this research aims at applying it to the design of driver assistance systems to make it cooperate with drivers by analysing the driver¡¯s EEG (Fig.1). When driving, a driver's brain is doing activities like recognition, judgment, and operation. If the feature of the EEG in this mental state could be ex tracted, the knowledge m ight be us eful to the design of driver assistance systems to prevent the m isrecognition of the driver, an operation m istake and etc. This paper describes the feature of recognition  and judgem ent extracted from  EEG in lane change maneuver using parallel factor analysis method. The experiment is conducted by using Driving simulators.  EXPERIMENTS SUBJECT INFORMATION  The subjects were 8 able-bodied (22-32 y ears old) and right-handed m ale. Subject information is shown in Table1. Subject A, B and C always drive the vehicle. Subject D and E are Sunday driver. Subject F, G and H have no experience in driving vehicle. Experim ent description was instructed to  all subjects and inform ed consent w as done before this experiment.

Electrode po sitions are F3 , F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, Fz, Cz and  Pz. The experiment was conducted by using DS  (Fig.2). This DS has the real vehicle fram e, 160 degree round screen and the he xapod actuators under the cabin to provide the body sensory acceleration during driving.  EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS The vehicle speed was set up autom atically at 80km /h. The subject was asked to sit on the driver's seat, and driv e to change v ehicle direction according to the given signal only by  steering m aneuver w ithout acceleration an d deceleration. Moreov er, the subject was  instructed by not only the timing of avoidance steering action but also the moving direction of the vehicle according to the surrounding vehicles situation. An experiment task was a simple thing in which the subject avoids co llision with other vehicles by steering. The experim ent paradigm of one trial is below. At the experi ment start, the subject' s vehicle was running in the center of the three-lane road, and other vehicles were running in all lanes ahead of the host     Fig.2 Driving simulator and experiment scenery Right steer Left steerStraight (No operation)Subject¡¯s vehicleLeading vehicleOperational direction is shownStartFinish06[s]Driver¡¯s intentionOperation24Signal of operation  start Fig.3 This shows a bird¡¯ s eye view of the experi mental paradigm  for one  trial. Subjects viewed leading vehicle on the each lane road. At 2.0-4.0 sec, they made the decision to drive e ither the lef t o r right s teer. Subs equently, they drove to avoid the stopping vehicles. vehicle. After 2.2 seconds, the steering direct ion was shown to the subject when one of  forward vehicles abruptly disappears from a lane in random order and two vehicles remain on their original lanes with turning on the brake lamp. After 4.0 seconds, a beep sound was given as the signal of operation start and the subject steers so that stopping vehicles may be avoided. After avoiding vehicles, the subject vehicle returns to the central lane, and one trial was finish. All subjects perform ed 10 sessions. Each sessi on consists of 15 tria ls with  r andomized direction. The subjects were able to have a break for every two session for 1 minute.  METHODOLOGIES PARAFAC FOR ERSP The EEG signals include not only the brain activity recorded near the electrode but also noise and brain activity in other places. Re moval of the noise elem ent from each electrode and  emphasis of the feature were performed using a Laplace of Gaussian (LoG) filter. The feature vector was calculated from the EEG of each elect rode after pre-processing with the wavelet transform. Mother wav elet was u sed f or th e complex morlet. W avelet transform and the mother wavelet can be defined as follows: ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þRba dtabtatxC1)(,             (1) tfjftbcb eefx ¡þ¡þ221)(¡þ¡þ¡þ         (2) Where x(t) denotes a m easurement signal, C denotes the co efficient of wavelet tran sform, a denotes the scale parameter of wavelet, b is the translation parameter of wavelet, ¦·(t) denotes the mother wavelet, fb denotes the band width parameter and  fc denotes the parameter of the center frequency.  Event-related spectrum potential (ERSP) is one  of the indices to be  induced by the brain activities and the power spectrum of EEG induced in relation to the event. The data matrix Sfdt of the electrode channel d at frequency f and at tim e t is given by the coef ficient of wavelet transform from each electrode signal. ERSP is shown as follows: ¡þ¡þ¡þnii dtfSndtfERSP12),,(1),,(      (3) where n denotes the number of all trials and i denotes the number of trial.

When the m atrix to obtain is data, Alternating Least Squares (A LS) is used and searched by m inimizing. The errors of ALS decrease by increasing the num ber of factors, while it conforms with the reference values excessively when there are too ma ny factors.

The number of factors which generally adapted itself by core  consistency is found and it can be expressed as follows: ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þf tdf tdNfNtNdftdNfNtNdftdftdTTSyconsistencCore11 1211 12)()(1_ ¡¡    (6) where Tftd denotes the predicting of 3 com ponent factor analysis model (TUCKER3). When the signal decompose d by the  ideal number of  factors, it is 100 %. We used the number of factors that this was more than 80%.  DETECTION METHOD USING PARAFAC This implies that the state of recognition or judgment could be estimated by using the factor model which is extracted by PARAFAC. The each component was shown using data matrix as follows: TtTdTf ABCXACBXBCAX )(,)(,)( ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ¡þ       (7) ][ 2211 MM abababAB ¡þ¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ¡þ       (8) where, X denotes the data matrix, A denotes the frequency factor matrix, B denotes the spatial factor matrix, C the denotes tem poral factor matrix and ¡þ denotes Khatri-Rao Product. If you want to detect the elem ents C, the factor  matrix of C was determ ined by Khatri-Rao Product for A  and B. From  the above equation, the spatial factor m atrix of B could be obtained from the C and A. However, because this equation was not ne cessarily nonsingular matrix, it could be expressed using the pseudo inverse matrix as follows: TTT ABPXPPPC )(;)( 1^¡þ¡þ¡þ ¡þ      (9)  RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS PARAFAC ANALYSIS RESULTS PARAFAC analyzed a 2.0-4.0 seconds of the experiment. The results of the subject A, B and C were able to decom pose for 3 factors. Oth er subjects were 2 facto rs. The resu lts of the subject A is shown in the Fig. 5-7. In thos e figures, the upper left  (a) is the frequency component, the upper right (b) is the tim e component and bottom  l eft (c) is the spatial component. The solid line shows the factor 1, the dashed line shows the factor 2 and the dotted line shows the factor 3. The steering directions are given to the subject in 2.2 seconds, and the cue of the operation start is given to them in 4.0 seconds. At first, the frequency component of each operation were decomposed by the ¦È wave band of 6-8 Hz, the ¦Á and ¦Ì wave band of 8-13 Hz and the ¦Â wave band of 13-30 Hz. In the tim e component, the relevance of second factor is become the maximum at the 2.5 seconds and the first factor is become the maximum at the 3.0-3.5 seconds and the third factor is increasing for 4.0 seconds. The time component has the same tendency as well as the frequency component for the all steering direction. In the spatial component, the first factor ( ¦È wave) has strongly relevance to the electrode of F3 and Fz. The second factor (¦Á and ¦Ì wave) has relevance to the electrode of P3 P4 and  Pz, and  th e th ird fact or has especially stro ngly r elevance to  th e electrode of F4. The results were  different among subjects regarding each factor of the tim e component and electrode channel com ponents. However, frequency com ponents were the same band of all subjects. From the view point of brain science, we consider the re sult of the PARAFAC analysis f or each factor. The relevance region of each factors were shown in Fig.8. At first, we investigate the first factor. Because relevance its high in the electrode of Fz, F3 and F4, it considers that it relates to the choice of the behavior and the recognition of the result in the future which is one of the executive functions of the frontal cortex. It was reported by Chun et al. using fMRI that the brain activities whic h become the sign of the judgm ent to push the left or right button occurred in the frontopo lar cortex (BA10) and the precuneus of  the parietal cortex, before pushing the button. Moreover, the frontopolar become activated w ithout the previous direction, and the precuneus become activated with the previous direction in the above report. We consider that this experiment is similar to above research about select judgments of lateral direction. T hus, it can think that brain activ ities about the judgm ent occur, before the movement. There were the sam e as the firs t factor region located in medial frontopolar and lateral frontopolar whic h relates to the judgment without previous direction of the above report. Based on the findings, it can be considered  that the first factor h as the feature of the brain activities about the presence or absence of the latera l operation. In addition, the second factor has the feature o f the br ain activity of the latera l judgment with previous direc tion, because it o ccurs in the precuneus of the pari etal cortex strongly. The above resu lts, imply that that s teering d ecision can b e detected from the difference of electrode relevance. Therefore the second factor and the detected steering decisions from EEG are focused on. The difference of the judgment between in right steer,  left steer and straight  is noticeable. Next, we investigate the factor 3. This factor is m easured only with the subject A who is frequency driver, and it occurs in the left hem isphere of frontal cortex str ongly. It is generally recognized that it has the function which don' t have a conflict with a object. Therefore, the brain function which doesn't collide with an object may function actively in the subject A. It was confirmed that there were two factors (¦È wave and ¦Á wave) which were common to all the subjects as shown in th e experim ental results. Theref ore, recognition or judgem ent estimated by calculating the rele vance of spatial com ponent from temporal and frequency components in the next section. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40051015x 105LoadingFrequency [Hz]2 2.5 3 3.5 400.050.1LoadingTime [s]F3 F4 C3 C4 P3 P4 Fz Cz Pz00.20.40.60.81LoadingChannel [-]  Factor 1Factor 2Factor 3 Fig.5 PARAFAC results of Right steer (Subject A)  5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40051015x 105LoadingFrequency [Hz]2 2.5 3 3.5 400.050.1LoadingTime [s]F3 F4 C3 C4 P3 P4 Fz Cz Pz00.20.40.60.81LoadingChannel [-]  Factor 1Factor 2Factor 3 Fig.6 PARAFAC results of Left steer (Subject A)  5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40051015x 105LoadingFrequency [Hz]2 2.5 3 3.5 400.050.1LoadingTime [s]F3 F4 C3 C4 P3 P4 Fz Cz Pz00.20.40.60.81LoadingChannel [-]  Factor 1Factor 2Factor 3 Fig.7 PARAFAC results of Straight (Subject A)  Precuneus posterior cingulate cortexFrontpolar cortex Lateral frontpolar cortex Fig.8 The occurrence region of each factor by PARAFAC for steering (subject A)  DETECTION RESULTS The feature detection was perform ed using the e xperimental data of subject A, because his results of PARAFAC analysis were similar in each steering operation. Feature to detect factors were temporal components and spatial com ponents in each operation. T he detection matrix calculated from experimant data of each steering operation. At first, we focused on the first o r second factor of each steering in th e detection matrix of temporal components. The detection results of the second factor were shown in Fig.9-11, and the detection results of the first factor were shown in Fig.12-14. In those figures, the upper is the first factor, the second is the second factor and the bottom is the third factor. The solid line shows the calculation from the right steer data, the dashed line shows the calculation resulting from the left steer data and the dotted line shows calculation resulting from the straight data. Although the relevance of the second factor increased at  the 2.5 second, the relevance of the first factor was flat in the experiment of right steering (Fig.9). In the left steering (Fig.10) and straight (Fig.11), the relevance of each factor was in  the same tendency as the right steering. In addition, there was a little difference to the each operation model. Those were similar to the results of PARAFAC analysis. Thus, the experimental results were considered that the driver recognized with prior infor mation. Although the re levance of the first factor increased, the relevance of the second factor did not vary  as can be noticed from  Fig.12-14. Since those results were also sim ilar to the results of P ARAFAC analysis, the experim ental results were considered that the driver recognized without prior information. Therefore, using the temporal components was difficult to detect the steering di rection. It was considered that it is possible to detect whether steering operation present or not. Next, we focused on th e second factor of each  steering in the detecti on matrix of spatial components. The detection results of the s econd factor were shown in Fig.15-17. In those figures, the upper is calculating from the right steer data, the middle graph is calculating from the left steering data and the bottom graph is calculating from the straight data. The solid line shows the electrode position of P3, the dashed line shows the P4 and the dotted line shows the Pz. The relevance of P 4 was m aximum at the 2.4 second in the right steer (Fig.15).

This might conclude that it is possible to detect the steering direction. However, misdetection of steering decision was found in another trial, because the feature of each intention not show difference among them.  CONCLUSION EEG of the drivers in lane change maneuver was measured by the experiments using a driving simulator, and it is inv estigate the  f eature of the EEG by PARAFAC analysis. It was confirmed that there  were two f actors (¦È wave and ¦Á wave) which were common to all th e subjects as shown in the experimental results. The difference of the judgment between in right steer, left steer and straight is noticeable. From detection results, it m ight be concluded th at it is pos sible to es timate the intention of  steering direction by com bining the de tection results fo r each com ponent. However, to improve the problems as misdetection, further improvement of the classification method will be done in future.  REFERENCES (1) J. R.
